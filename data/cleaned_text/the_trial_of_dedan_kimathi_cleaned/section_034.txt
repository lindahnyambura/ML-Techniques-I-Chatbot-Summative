CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THIS HOUSE THE UNSEEN GUEST AT EVERY MEAL THE SILENT LISTENER TO EVERY CONVERSATION. I ran away from school because the headmaster wanted to do wicked things with me. Always: you remain behind. You take the wood to my house. Yon take this chalk and books to the office. Then he would follow me and all he wanted was to touch my breasts. So, I left school. I wanted to stay home and teach myself how to sew or do something with my life. But my father would have nothing of it. He called me an idler and sent me to pick tea leaves for that cruel settler, Mr. Jones. How he used to abuse and punish us! I had to run a\vay from home, from my father, from Mr. Jones ....I n the city it was the boys. Always harassing me . . . A nd yet I did not want to starve I I lost my virginity while trying to run away from losing it. How else could I live? Yet, the money was so miserable. And sometimes they would beat me afterwards, calling me a child. No. I'll not run away again. A girl cannot run, run, run all her life. Enter Boy. BOY: : Coward. BOY: I really mean it. GIRL: Coward. BOY: I want to apologize. GIRL: A trick. Coward. Bully. Brute. I'll not run away from you. I'll never run away from anybody. Never. They stare at one another in silence, the Girl panting with anger, walking, knife in hand, towards him. They circle one another, as if weighing up one another. BOY: Drop that thing. GIRL: Come on, Brute Boy, Bully Boy. BOY: Drop that thing I tell you. Do you know what I am going to do with you? Get hold of you. Put you on my lap. Slap, slap your buttocks. Just to show you that I don't want to play with you. I don't want the money back. You can keep it. You needed it as much as I did. I was foolish to fight you over it. But unless you drop that thing . . . . GIRL: : All cowards, all brutes and bullies behave the same way. Show fear, a tail in your mouth, and they threaten thunder and rain. They humiliate you, insult you, injure you.
