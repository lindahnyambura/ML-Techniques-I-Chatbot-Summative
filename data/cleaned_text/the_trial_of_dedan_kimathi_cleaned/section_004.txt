He evolved his brilliant guerrilla tactics and his enormous organising capacity from the needs of the struggle. Karunaini people were proud of their son; they talked of him as a dedicated teacher, the committed organiser of a theatre group he named Gichamu, as a man with a tremendous sense of humour who could keep a whole house roaring with laughter. They talked of his warm personality and his love of people. He was clearly their beloved son, their respected leader and they talked of him as still being alive. 'Kimathi will never die', the woman said. 'But of course if you people have killed him, go and show us his grave I' She said this in a strange tone of voice, between defiance and bitterness, and for a minute we all kept quiet. We went back to Nairobi, turning over the words of those who had known Kimathi; had they themselves not shown us where he was shot and captured? Had they not told us that Kimathi's mother, although still deranged, was once allowed to see him in prison? Had they not told us about Kimathi's last testimony to be smuggled out of prison-that the struggle for Kenya's total liberation from foreign domination and oppression should continue until the wealth and the land was returned to the people of Kenya? Why then the sudden hostility when one of us raised the question of Kimathi's death? But there was also fire and enthusiasm in our hearts. We would try and recreate the same great man of courage, of commitÂ­ ment to the people, as had been so graphically described to us by the people who had not known of our coming. An even more important spur was the realization that the war which Kimathi led was being waged with even greater vigour all over Africa and in all those parts of the world where Imperialism still enslaved the people and stole their wealth.
