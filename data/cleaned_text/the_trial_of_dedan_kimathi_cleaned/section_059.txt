JUDGE: May everyone here present note that the accused has dismissed voluntary legal advice plactd at his disposal by the Government. I am, therefore, left with no alternative but to procede with prosecution, taking the accused to be his own defender. I will now repeat the charge for the very last time. The accused is advised to listen carefully and submit his plea. 80 THIRD MOVEMENT As he Is going through the above pronouncement, the collaborators grow even busier and more panicky. Gaceru whispers to Gatotia who in tum alerts a white police officer, seated in a comfortable chair, next to the corridor, in the row immediately ahead of them. _ The officer immediately rises and walks towards the woman, beckoni'ng Gatotia to follow by wagging a finger at him. Gatotia obeys. They lead the woman out but she hesitates directly opposite the dock to look at Ki'mathi who looks at her. She is pushed out of the courtroom where Gatotia chains her. As she is taken away, she breaks into triumphant singing (freedom song),jlooding the courtroom with her powerful, militant l'oice. There is whisperÂ­ ing and general excitement in the court. All this happens within forty or so seconds. Certainly in 110 more than a minute. SONG: Bururi uyu witu AnduAiru Ngai ni aturathimiire Na akiuga tutikoima kuo. Boy and girl enter-not in disguise. They squeeze into the space just vacated by the woman. The Woman's militant song continues to flood the courtroom. The judge pretends to be busy giving orders to the clerk but he is really only kililng an uncomfortable minute. Kimothi watches the Boy and Girl until they take their seats. JUDGE: : Silence in court I Will the guards at the court entrance ensure that no more latecomers are allowed into the courtroom. It is creating unnecessary commotion.
