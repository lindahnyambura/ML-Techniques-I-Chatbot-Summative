What more do we want? 45 SBONDO MOVEMENT JCIMATHI: And politics? Independence? Is this too for sale? POUTICIAN: We have bene given two alternatives. We can get in­ dependence, province by province. Majimboism. As a token of their goodwill, they have now allowed District and Provincial Political Parties. Independence for Central Province. After all, it's we Gikuyu. Embu and Meru who really fought for Uhuru. KIMATIU: Would you too call the war for national liberation a regional Movement? What has colonialism done to your thinking? : Hear me. Kenya is one indivisible whole. The cause we fight for is larger than provinces; it shatters ethnic barriers. It is a whole people's cause. POLITICIAN: There! Yo.u speak as if you can read my mind. The second alternative before us, you se,e is to receive uhuru as one people. IUMATIU: Receive uhuru! And since when did our people become beggars? Who are you? How can you decide for the people? Have they released our people from concentration camps? Have they released Jomo Kenyatto? Paul Ngei? Fred Kubai? Where is Achieng Oneko? Bildad Kaggia? Kungu Karumba? Are they out? Tell me more I POLITICIAN: They will be out soon. Personally, nothing concerns me more than their release. Everyone is fighting for tneir freedom. Tom Mboya, Ronald Ngala, Oginga Odinga, Daniel Moi, Julius Kiano. Petitions all over the country. Marches. Posters. Oh, Jet them come out. Then we shall form one country­ wide political party and serious negotiations wiU soon be in progress. In State House. In London. We shall sit around a conference table. We shall be given independence. KIMAnn: Givel Given! Give! Given! Given! Beggars. Hands outstretched. Ten cents. Thirty pieces of silver. Independence on a silver platter? Away. Vile creatures. Rats. Blood suckers. What? Blood? Yes. Your people's blood. Our people's blood. The blood of us workers and peasants. Yes, those are our peoplCJ. And you, New Farmers, New Settlers: Black skins, colonial settlers• htarts.
