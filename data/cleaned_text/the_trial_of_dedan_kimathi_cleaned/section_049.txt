WOMAN: Leader of the -landless. Leader of them that toil. BOY: : How do we really know that it is K.imathi that they have arrested and not another person? GIRL: I myself do not believe itl Because K.imathi would have known of the arrest and escaped in time. I have heard of the story of how once he wrote a letter to the Governor. He said he would dine with the Governor at State House. The Governor collected all the police in Nairobi to come and capture K.imathi. But K.imathi went there. He was disguised as a European Inspector of Police. Later, he wrote another letter to the Governor: Thank you for your dinner last night. And it was signed: F/ Marshal D.K. BOY: I have also heard it said that he could turn himself into an aeroplane. And also that before an attack on a garrison, he himself would go and blow a bugle from the inside.

He could also act and m.im.iQ any character iD the world: a story teller too. and many were the nights he would calm his men and make their hearts light and gay with humorous anecdotes.
