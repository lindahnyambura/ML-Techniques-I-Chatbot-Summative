Gatotia and the Second Soldier remove Kimathi's shirt roughly and lay him on the floor, still fettered. As Waitina lifts the whip lights go off and the audience only hear noise from the torture chamber. Gradually, semi-darkness. In semi-darkness we watcll the miming of black history (earlier enacted) going on, against the tortttring behind the scene. There should be as much harmony as possible between the action on the visible stage and the goings on in the torture chamber. WAITINA: : Where is Mathenge? : Where in your wild jJ,Jngles is Stanley Mathenge? : Matenjagwo? : Where? 56 SECOND MOVEMENT : Where? Speak. : Okay, he wants to talk. Leave off Gatoua. Let him talk. KIMATm: : What medal are you working for, traitor! Cursed vermin! WAITINA: Continue, Gatotial Teach him how to curse. : Stop Gatotia. Ready to talk now, Field Marshal? ,· Gatotial GA TOTIA: Sir I WAITINA: Hardcore's electric treatment now. GATOTIA: Yes Sir I WAITINA: : Where are Mathenge, Matenjagwo and the remaining terrorists? : Sign this letter and tell them to surrender. KIMAnn: That I will never do. WAITINA: All right then. I will show you . . . Kimathi, blood-stained, shirt torn, emerges from the torture chamber kicked, pushed from behind. He can hardly walk. He falls on his hands and .feet. Henderson, Waitina and Gatotia and the two soldiers follow, holding some of the instruments of torture. They stand in a group except the human soldier who stands apart, u·lightly hiding his face in shame. Kimathi is obviously broken in body . . . B UT not in spirit. HENDERSON: Now sign. Sign-surrender. He throws the piece of paper at Kimathi. It falls on the floor. Kimathi struggles to rise and now addresses himself to Gatotia and the soldiers.
