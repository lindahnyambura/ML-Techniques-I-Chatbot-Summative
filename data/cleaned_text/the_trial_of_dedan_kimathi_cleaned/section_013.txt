Remembering the woman, he turns back, gives a big knowing wink and then runs out. She makes some kind of obscene gesture at him, looks all around to detect the source of the noise and seeing no one appear, begins to collect bits of her scattered load. She puts the bread into her kondo first, collects the sweet potatoes and is in the process of collecting the oranges when she hears the voices of two KAR African soldiers who are walking in her direction. She grabs the scattered paper wrappings, a few more oranges and abandons the rest, rushing off to hide in the nearby bushes, just in time to auÂ·oid an encounter with the soldiers. FIRST SOLDIER: : Where are the terrorists who were supposed to be all over Nyeri? We've been patrolling all night without as much as catching sight of a single one of them. Simply harassing innocent villagers. The way mzungu makes us thirst to kill one another I SECOND SOLDIER: (irre/el'antly. Viciously]: The bloodyfuckin' Mau Mau are finished without that bugger Kimathi I FIRST SOLDIER: What is the idea of arresting a whole vilal ge then? SECOND SOLDIER: : For screening. These natives are very slippery, man. They are the same people as attacked the homeguard post last night trying to release K.imathi. But they will see. Their bloody Kimathi is appearing in court at Nyeri today. This afternoon. He is going to get a proper court trial. Not like the jungle ones he used to stage in the forest. See how fair mzungu is? FIRST SOLDIER: Ask me tomorrow if there is no attempt to rescue him. Something like what happened last night. 12 PIRST MOVEMENT SECOND SOLDIER: Personally. I don't think they will try again. Mau Mau. ... They are fuckin' cowards. They won't come out into the open in daylight and fight it out like men. FIRST SOLDIER: Well, they have been known to do just that many times. If the government wants to avoid trouble, it should take precautions. Make sure that sympathizers remain as far as possible.
