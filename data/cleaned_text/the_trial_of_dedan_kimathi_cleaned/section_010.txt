They are brought before Waitina who pierces tht!m with murderous eyes. Gakunia, the hooded collab­ orator, faces them. WAITINA: Leta karatasi yako. FIRST MAN: Sina.

SECOND MAN: I am a fruitseller. Matunda. I sing: "Oranges cheap today". WAITINA: : Kwenda screening. Lazima you go to Manyani to sell your fruits there. . Kw enda pesi! Wote march! The whole line goes across the stage. As they march past, we should see the man still looking anxiously about him as if he had been expecting to see someone and his plans had been frustrated. It is now proper daylight. A woman walks across the stage. She is between thirty and forty years of age, with a mature but youthful face, strongly built. Goodlooking. She wears a peasant woman's clothes and is barefoot. Though apparently a simple peasant, the woman is obviously world-wise, and percep­ tive of behaviour and society. Throughout, her actions are under control: her body and mind are .fully alert. Fearless determination and a spirit of daring is her character. She is versatile and full of energy in her responses to different roles and situations. A mother, a fighter, all in one.
