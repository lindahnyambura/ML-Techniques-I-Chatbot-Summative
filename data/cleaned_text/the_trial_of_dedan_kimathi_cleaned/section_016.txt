BOY: : It was in Nairobi, you see. She and I and other boys and girls used to roam the streets together. WOMAN: Don't be afraid now. Sit down here. Yes, you used to roam Lhe streets . Which streets? BOY: Eastleigh, Pumwani, Shauri Moyo, Bahati, Makadara and the centre of the city: Delamere Avenue, Hardinge, Kingsway, Queensway, Government Road-everywhere . WOMAN: Yes? BOY: : We scrounged into every dustbin from Kariobangi to Grogan Road. But mostly we'd hang around big hotels: New Stanley, Norfolk, Grosvenor. There were a lot of settlers and tourists and we would carry their bags. Sometimes we would act crippled or blind and deaf. They would give us money-some of them as much as ten shillings I The police would often come chasing us away, but we managed. Somehow. WOMAN: Go on. BOY: Then one day, myself and this girl were sitting outside New Stanley. As we were talking, a fat American came loaded with baggage : "Saidia maskini, sah Me and my sister can carry your bags." (feigning the American's appearance and speech while unloading imagined baggage and giving it to imagined totos]: "Here, you take this, boy.A nd your sister can take this, okay? Good boy. " 16 F1RS1' MOVEMENT : A beauddiful country . a beauddiful ciddy ... and beauddiful people, . . eh?" : "Take the baggage to that taxi over there. Understand 1 Good." : "Ahsonde soona"  BOY: : I gave her the money to go to get change while I waited for another American. She ran away. She never came back. I looked for her in Nairobi but she always managed to hide away f10m me. Nairobi is a big city, not like NyeriÂ­ a baby town. She disappeared. And then came the madness m.zungu called Operation Anvil and I was brought here. Today by luck, I saw her. WOMAN: So you decided to beat her? And you would have killed her because of five shillings-given you by a mzungu 1 BOY: I know people who have been killed for much less than that.
