So the challenge was to truly depict the masses (symbolised by K.imathi) in the only historically correct perspective: positively, heroically and as the true makers of history. Ngugi wa Thiong' o Micere Githae Mugo Nairobi, August, 1976. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank K.arari Njama and the publishers of Mau Mau From Within for permission to quote his version ofThu Song of Kimathi. We would also like to point out that although the faults and the shortcomings in the play are entirely ours, the play is a result of a collective effort with many concerned people freely giving us their comments and suggestions most of which we did incorporate into the play. It is impossible to name all of them except to say their comments were offered in the spirit of patriotism and of their hatred of Imperialism.

Prellmiaary Notes The atmosphere is tense and saturated with sadness, a.J if the whole land is in mourning. Elâ€¢ents move at a tremendous speed; people act with a general sense of urgency, as if to compete wilh time which is running ahead of them. The play is in three movements which should be viewed a.J a single movement. The action should on the whole be seen as bl'eaking the barrier between formal and infinite time, so that past and future and present flow into one another. The scenes (street, cell, courtroom) should also jfow into one another.
