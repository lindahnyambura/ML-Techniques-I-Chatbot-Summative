For, let me tell the fainthearted that this our struggle 44 SECOND MOVEMENT will continue until we seize back the right and the ability to make ourselves new men and women in our own land. BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: We have already won. KIMATHI: In spirit, yes. The spirit of our people, their will to life, freedom and power ...t his will never be broken. Your words of confidence and faith in our ultimate victory makes these chains light as feathers. For more of such words, I can take more, more . . . . BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: : Listen, Dedan. We have won the war. KIMAnu: : What? Have our oppressors surrendered? Freedom. We shall drive them out of our land, this earth, my brothers. Put our house in order. Build anew. Oh, the years of paint And you spear-bearers, where will you run to when the braves return under deafening sounds of drums proclaiming victory? But have they? My friends, you are twice welcome for bringing such news. My heart is full like Gura River in flood. Have they really? So long, so soon? Break these chains. Unchain my heart, my soul! Unchain four centuries of chains. Kenya, our dearly bought, fought for motherland. BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: It is not, eeh, exactly like that. But there have bene two important announcements. They have said: No more racialism. No more colour bar. In public places. In administration. In business. In the allocation of loans. In the grabbing, well, in the acquisition of land. Partnership in progress, that's the new motto. Is this not what we have been fighting for? Any black man who now works hard and has capital can make it to the top. We can become local directors of foreign companies. We can now buy land in the White Highlands. White Highlands no more. It's now: wilnli g Seller, willing Buyer. KIMATHI: WJ.at new song is this? Buy back our land from those who stole it from us? Our land? Have we not bought it with streams of blood? Rivers of sweat? BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: No free things. Colour bar is out. Banks are open to all.
