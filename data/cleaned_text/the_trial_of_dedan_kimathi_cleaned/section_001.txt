The Trial of Dedan Kimathi (1976) By Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Micere Githae Mugo PREFACE August 1971 was the first time that we were sitting together arguing out many issues since our undergraduate days at Makerere of the early 60's where we used to share man) literary interests including editing Penpoint, reading and directing plays. By this time both of us had already lived in North America and travelled in western Europe. Having encountered capitalism in its home ground, we were comple­ tely convinced that Imperialism was the enemy of all working peoples. There was America, for instance, with her huge highways, skyscrapers, the world's most efficient systems of communications, tremendous leaps in science and technology, every kind of material luxury one could think of, and yet, in the midst of these achieve­ ments, was the appalling poverty of workers especially those in the black and Puerto Rican Ghettos. All the advantages of modem science and technology, the wealth produced by the labour power of many people, went to the hands of a few. Amidst these were also the Indian reservations while abroad, were the giant American Imperialist projects of theft through deception, murder and enslave­ ment of the people of Africa, Asia and Latin America. There was the American direct occupation of Vietnam and South Korea: there was the indirect American control of South Mrica and Palestine. Truly, America's immense wealth was gained through the impoverishment arid misery of millions! We discussed the Vietnamese people's struggle against American Imperialism. They would surely win, we said. This led us back to Mau Mao, the actual subject of our discussion: was the theme of Mau Mao struggles exhausted in our literature? Had this heroic peasant armed struggle against the British Forces of occupation been adequately treated in our literature?
