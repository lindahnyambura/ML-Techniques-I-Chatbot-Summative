Know you that our Movement is facing a crucial test: One faction is advocating selling out And negotiating Creating a new colony Where we shall be mere pawns. We must denounce them! We must fight them out And root out the trend In our midst. ALL: Long live Kenya People's Defence Council! Long live Kenyan People's Freedom Armies! Hungu, Gati, Gaceru, are brought in. Then after a small interval, Wambararia, Kimathi's brother is brought in in chains. Kimathi is looking away from them. Slowly he turns round.

Several hands are raised, other generals and fighters anxious to speak. 1ST GUERILLA FIGHTER: Forgive them. Although they have done this It's their first offence. To kill them will diminish Our number.
