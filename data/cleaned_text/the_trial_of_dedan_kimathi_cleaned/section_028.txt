It's true that at times I play the Special Branch, a hunter of men, but at heart I'm a soldier. "To the point" is a soldier's motto. You see, I am not a poet and a dreamer like you. You must plead in court tomorrow. And you must plead guilty. KIMAlHI: Plead? Guilty? Pleading guilty? Guilty pleading. HENDERSON: Now, now, don't lash at me with those red eyes. KIMATHI: Do you think you deceived me? HENDERSON: When? KIMATIO: Today. In your court of jesters. HENDERSON: What do you mean? KIMATID: I must say you looked rather splendid in your prosecuting Judge's robes. Even handed justice. HENDERSON: I'm serious in my offer. KIMATHI: Go on. What's your offer? The next trick? HENDERSON: I've told you, you are too suspicious. It's not a trick. I give you my word as a British Gentleman. Plead guilty. We spare you life. KIMATm: You? Spare my life? What's at the root of this imperial magnanimity? I thought there was a piize on my head. HENDERSON: I'm a soldier. I called it a deal, not magnanimity. We want this war to end. Stanley Mathenge is still at large. Your confession and your co-operation would bring them all out. 33 SBCOND MOVEMENT ICJMAnn: And you would get another George Medal! Medals!

Do you take . me for a fool? HENDERSON: It was the same with all the others. China. Gati. Hungu. Gaceru. And even Waml::araria, your own broherl All our collaborators . At first they would not believe that I meant every word I said. But look, we have spared their lives. KIMATHI: H'm. You mean you took prisoner their lives! HENDERSON: Why must you twist what I say like that, Dedan?
