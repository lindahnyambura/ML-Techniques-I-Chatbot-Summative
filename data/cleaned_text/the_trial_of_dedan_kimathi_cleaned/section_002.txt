Why was Kenyan Litera足 ture on the whole so submissive and hardly depicted the people, the masses, as capable of making and changing history? Take the heroes and heroines of our history: Kimathi, Koitalel, Me Kitilili, Mary Nyanjiru, Waiyaki. Why were our imaginative artists not singing songs of praise to these and their epic deeds of resistance? Whose history and whose deeds were the historians and creative writers recording for our children to read? There was no single historical work written by a KenyUI telling of the grandeur of the heroic resistance of Kenyan people ftabdng foreign forces of exploitation and domination. a resistance movement whose history goes back to the 15th and 16th centuries when Kenyans and other East African people first took up arms against European colonial power-the Portuguese forces of conquest. murder and plunder. Our historians, our political scientists. and even some of our literary figures. were too busy spewing out, elaborating and trying to document the same colonial myths which had it that Kenyan people traditionally wandered aimlessly from place to place engaging in purposeless warfare; that the people readily accom足 modated themselves to the British forces of occupation! For whose unefit were these intellectuals writing? Unashamedly, some were outright defenders of Imperialism and lauded the pronouncements of colonial governors, basking in the sunshine of their pax-Anglo足 Mricana Commonwealths. So why not a play on these neglected heroes and heroines of the Kenyan masses? Kimathi for instance? Yes. We agreed. We would co-author a play on Kimathi and later on Koitalel and Me Kitilili I But how were we to do it with one of us in Nairobi and the other in New Brunswick? We would try co-authoring through correspon足 dence. This turned out to be too unrealistic, what with the distance and other commitments. It was not in fact until l974.
