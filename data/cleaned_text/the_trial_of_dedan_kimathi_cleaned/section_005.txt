It was crucial that all this be put together as one vision, stretching from the pre-colonial wars of resistance against European intrusion and European slavery, through the anti-colonial struggles for independence and democracy, to post-independence struggle against neo-colonialism. This would be in the spirit of the woman who told us that Kimathi would never die. As source material, Karari Njama's Mau Mau From Within became a very invaluable guide. Here was a man who had fought and lived alongside Kimathi, giving us a completely different picture of Kimathi and the Mau Mau War from what colonial writers had left behind in their works, like Henderson's The Hunt of Dedan Kimathi, Huxley's A Thing to Love, Ruark's Uhuru and Something of Value, to name only the most obvious. We agreed that the most important thing was for us to reconstruct imaginatively our history, envisioning the world of the Mau Mau and Kimathi in terms of the peasants' and workers' struggle before and after constitutional independence. The play is not a reproduction of the farcical 'trial' at Nyeri. It is rather an imaginative recreation and interpretation of the collective will of the Kenyan peasants and workers in their refusal to break under sixty years of colonial torture and ruthless oppression by the British ruling classes and their continued determination to resist exploitation, oppression and new forms of enslavement. In this we believe that Kenyan Literature-indeed all African Literature, and its writers is on trial. We cannot stand on the fence We are either on the side of the people or on the side of imperialism. African Literature and African Writers are either fighting with the people or aiding imperialism and the class enemies of the people. We believe that good theatre is that which is on the side of the people, that which, without masking mistakes and weaknes,ses gives people courage and urges them to higher resolves in their struggle for total liberation.
