For three days now We have debated many issues Thataffecttheconduu And the growing strength Of our Movement. Since we formed our six brave armies: ltuma Ndemi Army Gikuyu lregi Army Kenya lnoro Army Mei Mathathi Army Townwatch Battalions Kenya Levellation Army, We have had great victories. Our enemies all over Kenya Have not been able to sleep. That now they have called in Their best Generals : Latbbury, Hinde, Erskine And also Their latest fi&hter bombers Shows that we have hit them Where it hurts most. We now must open new fronts We have sent envoys to arouse Warriors from Nyanza, Giriama people at the Coast And also young Kalenjin braves, To set a grand alliance of Kenyan People And chastise the enemy for ever. 66 THIRD MOVEMENT We have also sent emissaries to Ethiopia To see if we can get a supply of Arms. But I must continue to stress That first and foremost We must rely on our strength As the most conscious, The best organized fighting arm of the Kenyan People. We must continue to make more guns I want to see every warrior with a gun Hand grenades Machine guns Molotov cocktails. Every camp, every mbuci, should have its own factory. We now have excellent blacksmiths Who can make guns and machine guns So you can't tell the difference between Ours and those captured from the enemy. Start clothing factories: We have excellent material From barks of trees and skins of animals. Put more effort in education: This earth will form our blackboards We must know our history Especially the deeds of those Who have always resisted The rape of our beautiful Kenya Who have always stood firmly Against oppression and exploitation. I could sing praise for them all day: Waiyaki, Me Katilili Mbatiani, Koitalel. And villify collaborators: Mumias, Wangombe Karuri, Gakure 67 THIRD MOVEMENT Kinyanjui, Luka- AII who sold us to foreignr.rs to aid their own stomachs and their family store. We must learn from our past strength Past weaknesses From past defeats And past victories.
