when we were .llready colleagues in the Department of Literature, University of Nairobi, that our dreams of 1971 materialised. The writing of The Trial of Dedan Kimathi has been both challenging and exciting. It has put us through a lot of education in connection with the continuing struggle against economic and other forms of oppression. We also discovered that Kimathi was still a hero of the Kenyan masses. One day. for instance, we visited Kimathi's birthplace (thanks to Mr. Mundia who organised the trip) with the aim of eliciting a firsthand assse sment of Kimathi from the people who had known him as a child, a villager and a guerrilla hero. It was a Sunday. The drive to Karunaini took us through beautiful valleys. ridges, hills and forests that helped the imagination recapture the countryside where the Mau Mau War was hottest and had often been fought out in pitched battles. Standing powerful and dominant to the north was K.irinyaga, the mountain at the foot of which the undulating Nyeri plains spread, rising to the Nyandarua mountains. Karunaini wu right next to Nyandarua Forest and, standing very near the school where Kimathi once taught, we could see the spot where he was finally shot down. The huge trench that the people were once forced to dig by the British forces so as to cut off the villages from the Forests was still visible. Among the group that stopped by the roadside to talk to us was a woman, who had once been Kimathi's pupil at Karunaini Independent School, and some four or five older men, who had known Kimathi since childhood. Had we too come all the way to sec where Kimathi was born 7 From them, we learnt a few factual stories as well as one or two conflicting legends about this great fighter. For instance, it is generally assumed that Kimathi fought in the Second 'World' War and people have tended to assume that that was where he learnt his military skills as well as his skills in making guns. Kimathi never fought in that war.
