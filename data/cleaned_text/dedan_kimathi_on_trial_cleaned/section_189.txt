the exact circumstances in which the appellant was shot and wounded, erred in accepting the uncorroborated evidence of that witness that the appellant had not, before he was shot, raised his arms and said “it is i, Dedan Kimathi. i have come to surrender. Don’t kill me. i have a pistol”. 5. That the learned Chief Justice misdirected the assessors by repeatedly emphasising the failure of the appellant to put forward his defence of lawful excuse until his trial and by im- pliedly inviting them to infer therefrom that the appellant had no such lawful excuse. 6. That the learned Chief Justice erred in considering the appel- lant’s omission to complain as more or less conclusive of the fact that he had not been shot while trying to surrender. 7. That the learned Chief Justice misdirected the assessors in law by inviting them to infer that the appellant was not intending to surrender because he had not so stated when charged before a magistrate on the 22nd of october, 1956. 8. That the learned Chief Justice misdirected himself in law by drawing as against the appellant an adverse inference by reason of the latter’s omission to make an exculpatory state- ment when charged by superintendent baker, and further, Appeal to the Court of Appeals for Eastern Africa i 153 misdirected the assessors by inviting them to draw a like inference. 9. That having regard to the fact that the appellant had been shot, seriously wounded and was presumably in considerable pain at the time of his meetings with the various prosecution witnesses (apart from superintendent baker) to whom it was suggested that he should have claimed that he was attempting to surren- der and/or complained that he was shot whilst so attempting, it was unreasonable to draw any adverse inference from the appellant’s silence. 10.
