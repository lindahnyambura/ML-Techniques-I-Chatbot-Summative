There was a space between the 2nd and 3rd shots longer than between the 1st and 2nd. From the place of our ambush to where we saw njogi, ndirangu and the others was about 500 paces . Mwangi Kanguru and Maina were posted nearer to the road than we were. i arrived with  Dedan Kimathi was being searched by Mwangi Kanguru. i saw Mwangi find a pistol which was slung from Dedan Kimathi’s right shoulder. The pistol was in a holster. i could recognise it. This (ex. 6) is the pistol and holster. Mwangi Kanguru kept the pistol for a short time and when sjt. Mwangi arrived, he handed it to him. a stretcher was made and Dedan Kimathi was taken to Kahigaini. i went off on a bicycle and reported to a european police officer at ihururu Police station. i returned to Kahigaini in a land rover with him and others. When i got there i saw Cpl. Wanjohi hand the pistol to the european police officer. it was still in the holster. The police officer took the pistol out of the holster. i saw him open the pistol and take out 6 rounds of ammunition and put them in his pocket. Then he handed the ammunition to his driver to hold. i did not at any time on this morning hear Dedan Kimathi say anything about wanting to surrender. i never heard anything of that kind. Cross-examined. between the 1st and 2nd shots there was only a few minutes. yes, i can tell the time. Q. What amount of time divided the 2nd from the 3rd shot? a. not quite 5 minutes. re-examined. between the 2nd and 3rd shots we were running towards the place we heard the shooting. i work out the 5 minutes by the distance 500 paces – say 5 minutes. We got up after hearing the second shot, realising there was a fight. When we heard the 3rd shot we had crossed the road and were going up. We had not got half way when the 3rd shot went off. We had gone about 100 paces 20. see Kimathi’s biography in the introduction to this volume. 64 i Document 1 from where we had been. We were running in the trench at that time. it was not difficult.
