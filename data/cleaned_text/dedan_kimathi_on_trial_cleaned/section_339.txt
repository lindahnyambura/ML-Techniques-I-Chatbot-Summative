While exercising identity-shaping disciplines and dis- cursive practices, Kimathi elevated himself over his peers, whom he was often given to criticizing as unlettered. They, in turn, accused Kimathi of having been poisoned by Christianity and Western education.70 it is not surprising that the modestly educated, like Kimathi, and the highly educated, like Karari njama, were disturbed by traditional Gikuyu prac- tices and superstitions, for instance, precolonial oath-taking elements, yet tolerated them for their utility.71 in due time, those who clung to tra- ditions and superstitions, deeming themselves to be authentic Gikuyus, retreated to the house of Gikuyu customs and closed the woven door (riigi) behind them. These Kimathi critics were weary of his bureaucratic Kenya Parliament with its incessant writing and record keeping and talks of making peace that they found untrustworthy. They accused Kimathi and other educated Protestant leaders of using their illiterate followers for their own selfish ends.72 on the other hand was the riigi of the colonial authorities. The co- lonial authorities, and the court, chose to look beyond Kimathiâ€™s motiva- tions, what he stood for, and what he was fighting for. That mattered little. it is little wonder that Kimathi was tried within the narrow legal param- eters of a court of emergency assize. Why he was in possession of both an unlicensed revolver and six rounds of ammunition was not in question.
