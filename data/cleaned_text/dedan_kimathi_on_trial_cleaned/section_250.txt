The settler leader, Michael blundell, pushed for a more rapid system of justice to be imposed, one that would clear the backlog of pending cases and ensure that those found guilty of crimes would be more speedily brought to the gallows. Though attorney General Whyatt was again reluctant to sanction changes that seemed to him to undermine the principles of english law, Governor baring worked hard to persuade the secretary of state, lyttelton, that such measures were urgently needed. by 12 June 1953, lyttelton had overcome opposition to the scheme in the Colonial office and the regulations for the new special emergency assize Courts were formally approved.16 These courts would sit in nairobi, nakuru, Githunguri, Thika, nyeri, nakuru, and (latterly) Thomson’s Falls, Meru, and embu, and would hear only cases relating to the emergency Powers regulations. a number of magistrates were declared as special acting judges to preside at the new courts, and given the full powers of a High Court judge. special sittings of the appeals court were also provided for, so as to speed up the process- ing of cases after conviction, with the intention of moving convicts more rapidly to execution and preventing a buildup of persons awaiting appeal 236 i David M. Anderson under sentence of death. baring also managed now to get approval for the summary dismissal of appeals where no obvious legal ground could be established—a measure that london had previously refused to sanction.17 locating all trials close to the areas where offences were committed and trimming down the appeals procedure had an immediate impact in accelerating cases, but the most significant legal change was the removal of the requirement for a committal proceedings before a supreme Court prosecution of a capital offense.
