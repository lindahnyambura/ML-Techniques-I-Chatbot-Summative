reasons for this may include the fact that the courtroom photograph was taken head-on at eye level, whereas the second was shot from above, thereby diminishing the subject. The latter image shows Kimathi supine, rendered helpless, injured, and handcuffed, whereas he sits upright with his upper body clothed in the first image, albeit still handcuffed.1 in the dock, Kimathi’s dreads stand out from his head in two bunches, forming a natural circular frame reminiscent of a bull’s horns, a shape that lends itself to mass reproduction.2 The composition of the second image makes it more difficult to copy and mass-reproduce; in some versions Kimathi’s head is turned slightly to one side, and his hair has been piled on top of his head—the dreaded dreads are thereby rendered (deliberately?) less visible at this steep angle.3 in the courtroom photograph, taken presumably by an official brit- ish photographer, Kimathi (who understood the importance of manag- ing publicity, and in 1953 had sent the british authorities a photograph of himself on learning that they did not have one) is critically gazing back 339 at empire, represented by the body of the photographer.4 The image is in- variably accompanied today in popular artwork by the quote attributed to Kimathi, which is in fact believed to have been coined much earlier by others: “it is better to die on your feet than live on your knees.”5 it implies “no surrender.” all this is grist for the mill of popular memorialization.
