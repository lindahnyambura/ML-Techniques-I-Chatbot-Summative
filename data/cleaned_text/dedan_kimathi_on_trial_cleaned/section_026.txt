but from the index of his files and conversations with the archivists at Churchill, it seemed unlikely that the trial would be among its contents. next, i went in search of Foot’s associate, a lawyer named ralph Millner. often described as a “socialist” or “communist” lawyer, Millner defended several african trade unionists and liberation leaders against colonial prosecutions, wrote booklets on soviet justice, and worked on multiple high-profile cases across the british empire. Millner’s papers were housed at the institute of Commonwealth studies at senate House library in london. The archivist at the institute informed me on my visit in May 2015 that Millner’s papers had only recently been catalogued and that, to his recollection, no scholar had yet made use of them. The files proved incredibly rich, revealing the fascinating career of this “socialist” anticolonial british lawyer. and there it was, among Millner’s eclectic papers, a complete, origi- nal, and certified transcript of the trial of Dedan Kimathi. The file’s cover contained the proper citing of the trial’s case number and was embossed with the seal of Her Majesty’s supreme Court of Kenya. The paper was the thin, semitranslucent sheets that were used at the time to allow for multiple copies to be produced at once. in addition to the trial, Millner’s papers also included reproductions of several of the exhibits submitted during the trial, usually destroyed after such proceedings, and marginal notes from both the judge in the case and Millner himself. after consult- ing again with scholars, archivists, and members of the judiciary, i could now confidently attest that the copy of the trial found among Millner’s papers was authentic. a few weeks later, upon my return to Kenya, ever more material began to emerge.
