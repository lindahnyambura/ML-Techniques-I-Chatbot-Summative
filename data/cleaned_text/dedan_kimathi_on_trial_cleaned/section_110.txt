The bullet had hit the thigh bone. The continuity of the bone had not been affected. it was still one long bone – but the projecting part had be shattered – pieces chipped off. a man with that wound could crawl with difficulty. i saw no marks of burning on the wound. i did examine the clothing and found no marks of burning but it would be difficult to find any as the clothes were dirty and bloody. i operated.
