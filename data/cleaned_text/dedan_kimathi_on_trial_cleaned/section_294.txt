Friends and rivals in the enterprising, now incipiently capitalist, pursuit of self-mastery were thrown together or apart by the unpredictable demands of survival.50 a torment in moral economy overwhelmed any strategy the insurgent organizers had had in mind—and some remember an intended massacre of whites.51 under further british pressure anticolonial resistance became african civil war, a mosaic of undecided loyalties that perturbed the british as much as they later alarmed Kimathi. it was perhaps to counter this uncertainty that insurgents were such sticklers for paperwork; never was there a more bureaucratic subversion. some members had burned their hated passbooks (sing., kipande); the movement forged their replacements. activists also registered all who took a second, fighting (mbatuni, platoon) oath. a forest general’s brief- case, never found, was said to hold the names of seventy-five hundred men under command; schools were raided for exercise books; Kimathi’s diaries confirmed his responses to interrogation.52 Two forest secretaries—Karari njama, Kimathi’s critical supporter, and Kahinga Wachanga, a bitter opponent—survived to write the two most informative war memoirs.53 a managerial instinct for uniformity prompted the decision to omit from the movement’s oaths any appeal to ancestral witnesses. These might well have cautioned landowners who knew their lineage of descent but could only divide Gikuyu at large.54 Mythical ancestors or past generations were dif- ferent; they unified—a reflection that raises the question of how the move- ment was known. Militants quarried myth, memory, and moral economy for names. one of the commonest, Gikuyu na Muumbi, the ethnic abraham and sarah, came from myth out of mission literacy. in 1924, Marion steven- son, a scottish missionary, published a Gikuyu-language primer for use in schools. it told of a covenant between God, the Gikuyu people, and their fertile land.
