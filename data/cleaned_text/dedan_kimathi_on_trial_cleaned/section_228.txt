MessaGe The Kenya parliament assembled on the 15th. oCTober, 1954 at the above named place and continued on with its discussions up to the 20th. oCTober, 1954.68 66. exhibit no. 22a, english translation of Kimathi letter, Criminal Case no. 46 of 1956, Dedan Kimathi v. regina, Her Majesty’s supreme Court of Kenya at nyeri, Kimathi File, archives of the supreme Court of Kenya. 67. This document is a word-for-word copy of the english translation of the original Gikuyu-language letter, prepared by government translators and admitted as evidence during the trial of Dedan Kimathi. The identity of the translator is unknown, but clearly he works with the political categories of the colonial state. The translator is quick to render Gikuyu words in politically and legally actionable nomenclature: thus Kimathi’s term “ĩhĩĩ,” a word mean- ing “uncircumcised young men” (or “boys”), is rendered as “terrorists” in this translator’s usage. The translation was made in haste by someone who was not looking for nuance. as a result there are numerous mistranslations and mis- readings of the text. in these footnotes we elucidate alternate meanings and highlight vocabularic references that might have occurred to Dedan Kimathi, the author of the Gikuyu original. 68. The Gikuyu says “up to today, the 20th of october 1954.” 199 amongst other matters discussed it was agreed that the Kenya Government should be informed, as should all other people in Kenya,69 of those matters which would have to be resolved. These matters were unanimously agreed upon by all the war leaders from all of the areas of the forest.
