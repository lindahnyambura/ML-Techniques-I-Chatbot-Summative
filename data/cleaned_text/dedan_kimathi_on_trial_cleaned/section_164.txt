but that though important is not in itself an issue. The real issue in this case is: is it true or is it not true that the accused had this pistol and ammunition because he was coming into surrender and was bringing his firearm with him in response to the surrender leaflet? The circumstances in which he was wounded are only material to the extent that they may help to decide that issue. you should concentrate on any evidence which helps you to answer the surrender issue. senior suPerinTenDenT baKer C.i.D. on the 22/10 baker charged accused with two offences – possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition – each without lawful authority or lawful excuse. Charges were interpreted by Wambugu. To that the accused replied: “i would like to say that i never knew that there was such a law”. (Tells the interpreter that he wants to think) after an interval of about 20 seconds says: “i have nothing more to say”. you will consider whether he was then saying that he didn’t know that there was a law against carrying a loaded pistol. accused does not now attempt to say that he didn’t know that it was, generally speaking, an offence to possess a firearm and ammunition and he says that he never meant that. He says that what he meant was “i didn’t know that there was such a law for a person coming in to surrender himself”. He says his mind was blurred with the effect of his wound, his operation, it is suggested that he may have had an epileptic fit while under anaesthetic. (There is no evidence whatever that any such fit did in fact occur. The evidence is merely that anaesthetics do sometimes or often produce fits in epileptics and if he did have one the mind might be blurred for up to 48 hours). one doctor says his mental condition might have been blurred. The surgeon who examined him says that his opinion was that the accused’s mental condition was clear and normal.
