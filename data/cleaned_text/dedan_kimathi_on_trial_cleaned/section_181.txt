The accused dropped his sugar cane and two maize cobs that he had in his hand and ran. He had no idea who was firing at him. before he had gone far, he heard a second shot. The shots appeared to come from the direction of the road. He ran fast along the trench and was still running when he heard a third shot. He was not hit. He got out of the trench on the reserve side and sat down under a castor oil tree about ten yards away. There was a steep slope there down to the Thengeraini river. He squatted on his haunches with his knees open. He sat there for about 20 minutes facing down towards the stream in the valley, after which he saw a man come up from below him – in front and slightly to his left. He noticed that the man was wearing uniform and took him to be a policeman. He raised his arms and said: “it is i, Dedan Kimathi. i have come to surrender. Don’t kill me. i have a pistol”.
