according to Henderson’s own account, the Mau Mau leader’s hideout had been found by 16 october, and the security forces had laid a careful ambush there to catch Kimathi on his return. There was nothing at the camp to indicate that Kimathi had left without intending to return—clothing and equipment were left in the hideout, neatly arranged Mau Mau on Trial i 251 and ready for use, and there was buck meat and vegetables in the food store.58 The next day, 17 october, Kimathi was seen by one of Henderson’s Kikuyu officers, ruku, darting across a clearing after he had fired on the security patrol. on the following day Kimathi was encountered again, this time he and his remaining companions being chased through the forest as they conducted a firefight with their pursuers. Kimathi escaped yet again but was now separated from his final comrade, Maragua, while his female companion, Wanjiru, was captured. These dramatic events left Kimathi alone, without food, and with only his revolver and simi for protection, and now knowing that his camp had been located and was probably am- bushed. Henderson calculated that Kimathi’s only course would be to leave the forest to get food from the Kikuyu reserve area, and so stop lines were set along the forest boundary of Tetu location at the two points where the Mau Mau leader was most likely to emerge. Men of the Tribal Police, the Kenya Police, and the King’s african rifles took up positions on the night of 18 october, and on 19 october the security forces tracking Kimathi con- firmed that he had, indeed, moved to the forest fringe along the boundary with Tetu. it was at the southernmost of the Tetu stop lines that ndirangu shot Kimathi, at 6:30 a.m. on the sunday morning of 21 october. nothing in Kimathi’s behavior over these days suggests a man who was contemplating surrender, though his situation was increasingly des- perate.
