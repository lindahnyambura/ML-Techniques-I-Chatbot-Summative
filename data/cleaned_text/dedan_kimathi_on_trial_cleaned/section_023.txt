Kimathi, in ngũgĩ and Mũgo’s production, stands before the court and de- clares his undying commitment to the Mau Mau cause. He gives a history of the movement, of the “Kenyan masses,” and of the oppression suffered under british rule. While ngũgĩ and Mũgo make clear in the preface that their work was “not a reproduction of the farcical ‘trial’ at nyeri” but rather “an imaginative recreation and interpretation of the collective will of the Kenyan peasants and workers,” without the actual trial transcript available for academic and public examination, ngũgĩ and Mũgo became respon- sible for constructing the popular postcolonial imagination of the trial and the man himself. and yet, as ngũgĩ and Mũgo submit in their foreword to this volume, theirs was an imagining of the trial, and of Kimathi him- self, that rejected “the entire assumptions underlying that british kangaroo court in nyeri.” The absence of the archival record of Kimathi’s final stand, at least in part, created a space for popular mythmaking and the continual reimagining of this contested past. The Hunt for (the Trial of) Dedan Kimathi The location of the archival record of Kimathi’s trial, much like the fate of Kimathi’s body, has remained a mystery. unlike the british intelligence and colonial records described above, the records of colonial trials mostly remained in the colony where they were produced, most often in multiple certified sets kept at various levels of the judicial process that could include, but were not limited to, sites of appeal outside the colony. Many scholars, writers, journalists, politicians, and activists have gone in search of the Kimathi trial. The tireless journalist and author Joseph Karimi lamented the impossibility of locating the file in his 2013 biography of Kimathi.36 i recently came across a letter from no less than the late J. M.
