Here i would like to acknowledge my indebtedness to the scholars, archivists, public figures, and museum curators who variously opened doors, sent e- mails, located dusty boxes in forgotten corners, and shared with me the in- tense excitement and sense of possibility when we could finally say we had located the trial of Dedan Kimathi, absent from view, it would seem, for almost sixty years. Finding the trial would not have been possible without the dedicated and enthusiastic support of people across multiple institu- tions in Kenya: former chief justice Willy Mutunga, former deputy chief justice Kalpana rawal, stanley Mutuma, rose Wachuka, atieno odhi- ambo, naim bilal, richard otene, Peterson Kithuku, richard ambani, Francis Mwangi, James nyaga, betty Karanja, Tabitha Kanogo, Maina wa Kinyatti, aghan odero, Joseph Karimi, and billy Kahora. Thanks also to the numerous scholars and students at Dedan Kimathi university of Tech- nology (nyeri) who provided feedback at a conference in 2014. in london, richard Temple at senate House library provided immense assistance and, as it turned out, the key to finally locating the trial of Dedan Kimathi. xix This volume would not have been possible if one of the most influen- tial scholars in african history had not said yes when a young scholar pre- sented him with a crazy idea. John lonsdale has been unwavering in his support of this project, lending his counsel, his vast networks, his stagger- ing historical recollection, and his name, which undoubtedly encouraged others to sign on as well. Throughout, he has been a steadfast champion and critical intellectual, and personal, resource. all the contributors to this volume have lent significant time and ex- pertise to realizing this project. Dr. Willy Mutunga, 14th Chief Justice & 1st President of the supreme Court, republic of Kenya, was an early sup- porter of the project and proved a knowledgeable and passionate interloc- utor.
