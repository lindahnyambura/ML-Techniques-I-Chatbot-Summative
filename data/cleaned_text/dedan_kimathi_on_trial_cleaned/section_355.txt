For more on problems of the philosophy of law, see brian leiter and Michael sevel, “Philosophy of law,” Encyclopedia Britannica (online): http://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy-of-law. also see Kenneth einar Himma, “Philosophy of law,” in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http:// www.iep.utm.edu/law-phil/#H2. according to leiter and sevel, sociological jurisprudence concerns itself with the effects of social phenomena on both the substantive and procedural aspects of law, as well as on the legislative, judicial, and other means of forming, operating, changing, and disrupting the legal order.
