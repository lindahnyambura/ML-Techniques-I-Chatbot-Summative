if he is granted an adjournment, my colleagues and i are all of opinion that he will be fit to continue his trial to-morrow. Miller: i apply for an adjournment until to-morrow. adjourned till 10 a.m. 20/11/56. K.K. oâ€™Connor 19/11/56. 20/11/56. 10 a.m. resumed. Denis WilliaM HaMilTon Hurley. sworn, states: F.r.C.s., M.s. Provincial surgeon, nyeri General Hospital. accused has been my patient since 21/10/56, when i operated on him for a gun-shot wound in the right thigh. in my opinion he is considerably better and progressively improving. i have examined him this morning together with the Prison Doctor admiral Twigg and the Provincial Physician. He does not complain of headache this morning. This morning he complains of pain in the right hip region. He says it may interfere with his listening to witnesses and actively concentrating on the trial. He is more comfortable in the chair than on a stretcher. He says that he wants to go on with the trial now. i think that he is fit to go on with the trial. i think that he has got the pain, but i do not think that the pain is severe enough to disturb him much. The symptoms of the pain are subjective. i would have thought that the patient would be at the moment almost entirely free from pain, but if he complains of Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 49 severe pain that is something that i cannot deny. There is nothing but his statement to show whether he is in severe pain or not. at the moment his temperature is normal: and pulse normal, and his general condition excellent at the moment. Cross-examined Miller: The sciatic nerve is in some way affected but in my opinion that is not the cause of this pain. i would be able to tell if it was. To Court. This pain of which he now complains is something new. i heard of it this morning. in my opinion the accused is fit to continue now subject to a possible adjournment should he complain later: there is no medical reason why that course should not be pursued.
