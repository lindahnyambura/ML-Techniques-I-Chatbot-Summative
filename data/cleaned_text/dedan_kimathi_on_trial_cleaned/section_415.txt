The interviewees in the video appear to be exclusively Gikuyu, which belies what nMK staff have previously said (for example, at exhibition-planning meetings i attended) about the need to broaden “the story of Mau Mau” to include people from other ethnic groups, in line with the KHrC campaign described earlier. The poisoned word “loyalism” barely appears in this particular space, other than in the (presumably colonial-era) caption “loyalist guards keep watch over Mau Mau suspects at langata camp,” and a Home Guard’s badge (unexplained).
