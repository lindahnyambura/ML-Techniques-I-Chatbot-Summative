These images apparently showed only victims of the first massacre (though some scholars cast doubt upon this).26 There was virtually no coverage of the second, for obvious reasons.27 lari has been described variously as “the crucial turning point in the Mau Mau war,” “the war’s iconographic moment,” and “a pivotal moment” in propaganda terms.28 in Petals of Blood, ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o called it “the storm-centre of Kenya’s history.”29 He also wrote about it in his childhood memoir, since it happened close to his boyhood home.30 briefly, this is what happened at lari on the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh of March. Though often referred to in the singular as a “massacre,” especially by Kenyans (including in the final report of the Truth, Justice and recon- ciliation Commission),31 there were in fact two massacres within hours of each other: the first, on the night of the twenty-sixth, involved an at- tack by several hundred Mau Mau (only a small fraction of them forest fighters) on their neighbors’ homesteads, which resulted in an estimated seventy-four deaths. What lay behind the attack were long-simmering dis- putes over land, a contentious eviction, and widespread hatred of “loyalist” Chief luka wa Kahangare; he and his family were virtually wiped out. all victims of the first massacre were carefully targeted government servants, clients of luka and another chief, Makimei. The second massacre occurred between ten at night and dawn the following morning, in a retaliatory Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 343 counterattack initiated by Home Guard, joined later by british forces and other africans under british command. The reprisal was vicious and cha- otic, with revenge taken in cold blood on anyone suspected of having Mau Mau sympathies.
