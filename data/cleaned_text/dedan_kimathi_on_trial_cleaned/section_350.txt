a man who, aiming for nei- ther pelf nor comfort, ventured all to put, in one act of violent resistance, the invisible thought in his mind. a man who is in anybody’s eyes and for all times will remain, a liberator, for he sought the ideal of self-mastery and freedom stemming from the restoration of alienated african lands. This man, Kimathi, must stand like a Hercules, an achilles, a rüstem, an arthur, or a Cid in the mythology of the Kenyan state; and in its authen- tic history, like a leonidas, a scipio, a Caesar, a richard Cœur de lion, a nelson, a Grand Condé, a bertrand du Guesclin, a Doge Dandolo, a na- poleon, a Masséna, and a ney.91 but this is now a matter before the court of public opinion, which must decide this now reopened case: one between what Kimathi stood for and his stated cause, and that of Mau Mau, versus an obsolete and paranomon british colonial justice system. Notes 1. These two masterful studies, anderson’s Histories of the Hanged and elkins’s Britain’s Gulag, among a few others including that by bennett, Fight- ing the Mau Mau, were vital for the manner in which they revealed hidden histories of britain’s imperial past in Kenya and the 1950s Mau Mau counterin- surgency in particular. These three revealing studies relied heavily on material that had for decades remained concealed in a secret archive deep in the buck- inghamshire countryside in Hanslope Park, sometimes referred to as “spook central.” elkins, anderson and bennett, therefore, were the first to pierce through the enshrouding in silent mystery of what exactly transpired during the emergency in colonial Kenya. The bluff by a colonial official that some Mau Mau records would not be made available to the public, not even after fifty years, was thwarted.
