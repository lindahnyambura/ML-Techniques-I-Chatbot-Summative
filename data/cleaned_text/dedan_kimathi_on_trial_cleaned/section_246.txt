The ambiguities surround- ing Kimathi’s leadership of the Mau Mau movement, first highlighted in Karari njama’s account of the forest armies, published in 1966,5 have been largely ignored in subsequent nationalist histories, leaving plenty of scope for fictionalized speculation and mythmaking.6 Kimathi’s iconic status in Kenya’s nationalist history surely remains undeniable, yet his behavior in the forest among his comrades, his relations and negotiations with the british, and his reputation as a rebel leader, all bear much closer scrutiny than they have had from historians thus far.7 The circumstances of Kimathi’s capture, trial, and execution, as re- counted through the documents assembled by the british for his prosecu- tion in the special emergency assize Court at nyeri, in november 1956, 233 therefore presents an opportunity to review what is known of his life dur- ing his four years in the forests of nyandarua (the aberdare), and what this tells us about the Mau Mau movement and its ultimate defeat in the face of a fierce british counterinsurgency campaign.8 This chapter contrib- utes to this revisionist task by providing a detailed, factual examination of the character of the legal proceedings under which Kimathi was prosecuted, contextualizing the trial in the colonial justice system imposed under Kenya’s emergency Powers. The trial was functional and ordinary, but also laden with political significance and potency—factors of which the british were acutely aware. Kimathi’s trial was but one among more than twelve hun- dred special emergency assize hearings conducted to prosecute alleged Mau Mau adherents between July 1953 and December 1956.9 The processes and procedures of the court followed a well-established pattern, nothing of which was compromised to accommodate Kimathi’s celebrity, but some of which was elaborated in ways that were not generally available to other accused in such trials.
