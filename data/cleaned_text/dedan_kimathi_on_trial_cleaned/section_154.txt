Therefore, to save waste of time in reviewing the evidence twice, i will tell you now what points the Prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt on Count 2 and then i will review the evidence on both counts together. 2nd Count. in order to justify a conviction on the 2nd Count, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (i) that the accused at Tetu in s. nyeri on the 21/10/56 had in his possession six rounds of .38 calibre ammunition; (ii) that the circumstances were such as to raise a reasonable presumption that such ammunition was intended to be used in a manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order. if the prosecution prove those two points against him, the accused may then show that it is more probable than not that he had a lawful excuse for having the ammunition and if he does that is an answer to the charge. as to the second point. The accused says that he possessed this ammunition because he was coming in to surrender it as instructed by the surrender leaflets. if that was true, he not only had a lawful excuse, but there would be no circumstance which would cause a reasonable presumption that the ammunition was intended to be used in a manner prejudicial to public safety. if, on the the other hand, that is not true then you have to consider whether or not the circumstances were such as to cause a reasonable presumption that the ammunition was intended to be used in a manner prejudicial to public safety. The prosecution say that this man was, on the 21/10/56 still a leading Mau Mau terrorist, going about armed and that it is notorious that Mau Mau terrorists do use their arms in a way which is prejudicial to public safety. They ask you to say that it was a reasonable presumption from the circumstances that the ammunition was intended to be so used. ProseCuTion eViDenCe. ndirangu s/o Mau.
