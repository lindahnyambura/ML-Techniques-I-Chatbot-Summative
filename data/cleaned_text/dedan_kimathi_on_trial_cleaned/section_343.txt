bearing the torch of dissent, Chizi’s subliminal nationalism mourns the silencing of the voices of the people bereft of their dreams by the prom- ise of warm and nutritious but empty democracy. in a tone reminiscent of Kimathi’s passionate protestations for justice and truth, Chizi laments that people in Kenya have been served a democracy that does not fill their bellies; a democracy that does not deliver jobs; a democracy that does not give people a source of income; nor one that brings about peace and unity.78 it is clear from this song, and numerous others produced by Chizi and other artists, that the struggle that Kimathi symbolizes is still on today. but no one demonstrates this continuity more powerfully than the group ukoo Flani Mau Mau’s music video “Angalia Saa” (look at the Times). The song is dedicated to all Kenyan heroes who struggled against british colonialism but have never been honored. To demonstrate both the continuity of the struggle for freedom and their admiration of their ideological forebears, the group visually plays with time and space in its audio and visual representations. using song lyrics and video images, these time-warping artists present the past while simultaneously familiar- izing the present. They assert that the postcolonial state is in stasis since everything remains the same as it was in colonial times. The song dra- matizes the Mau Mau moment by overlapping old video clips of british military crackdowns and images of arrested Mau Mau suspects in screen- ing and detention camps with clips of more recent political crises. Thus, these artists creatively merge the times, the emergency period, and the present struggle in an unbroken continuity, transcending time and space.
