because the line of the wound was upwards; therefore the gun was fired from below. The entry wound would have to be horizontally above the muzzle of the rifle. if the rifle were fired by a man standing, he would have to fire upwards. Q. The slope has been estimated at 1 in 7. Do you think it would be possible to cause the wound in that way if the firer and the man were close enough to talk? a. it depends on how close is “close enough to talk”. i should say it was unlikely. To CourT: i don’t think it likely that this would {wound} could have been caused by a rifle fired, from a distance of 10 or 15x away, if fired from the shoulder at a man squatting on the ground. WiTness To Miller (with leave): My last answer depends entirely on the slope. if the slope is more than 1 in 7, my answer might have been in the contrary sense. yes: if i saw this spot i could give much more definite answers to these questions. Miller: i apply for the Dr. to go to the place and see it and give his answers then. it is only a few miles from the Court. soliCiTor-General: i have no objection, but would it help? Miller: i ask that he go with Vidler or blackman. 82 i Document 1 orDer. on application of the Defence, witness may go to the place and see the castor oil bush and the slope of the ground with superintendent Vidler or blackman.
