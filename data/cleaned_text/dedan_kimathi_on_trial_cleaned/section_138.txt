Churchill, 1949). 106 i Document 1 “epilepsy may exist without obvious intellectual impairment ..... insanity.” i agree with that. XXD. s.G. There are many forms of idiopathic epilepsy. The main symptom is a sudden loss of consciousness. i observed no symptoms in the accused. usually a diagnosis has to be made on a story from observers. i based my opinion solely on what i have been told by Dedan KiMaTHi himself, his mother and Joseph WaKaba. i do not know whether he has come from a Detention Camp. i think Dedan KiMaTHi is a reasonably intelligent man intelligent above the standard of a man of his education. i make no suggest that he is insane. He knows what he is doing and he knows the difference between right and wrong. He has been under constant observation since 21st octr. and he has had no fit during that month. if an operation took place about 12.30 on sunday 21st ..... i first examined him on the 9/11/56. He was then physically fit. Q. Hurley said that he stood the operation well and that he ex- amined him again on the following morning. apart from pain and stricture of urine he did not complain of anything and he appeared to be mentally alert. if he had had a fit the previous day, would Dr. Hurley have discovered it? a. i think it likely he would have discovered that he was mentally cloudy. if he had had a headache and mental cloudiness, i would have expected him to mention it, particularly if Dr. Hurley’s examination were carried out for the purpose of ascertaining whether he was fit to answer questions. if he had had an epileptic fit under the operation, the surgeon might still say that he stood the operation very well. yes, i would expect the mental clouding to continue for anything up to 48 hours afterwards.
