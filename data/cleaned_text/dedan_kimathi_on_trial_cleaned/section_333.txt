There is nothing automatic about the emergence of “a people.” With him were people who, while sharing certain substantive values, consisted of multiple selves, people constituting their identities in a plurality of subject positions.49 although aspiring to forge the wishes of the people into a new polity of citizens, an ordered, lawful, and progressive society, as a leader of a loose coalition with divergent interests, Kimathi eas- ily became a blank canvas upon which was inscribed various political de- mands and ends. in addition, he was a suspended hegemon in the making without firm or well-established authority, a floating signifier rather than a fixed one that was pinned down, ordering the form of debate, irrespective of the content. not having achieved fixity that avails hegemonic power, his authority was subject to the harsh audit of his peers. it comes as no surprise then that Kimathi was less known for his prowess as a field general than for his motivational speeches and his legendary obsession with the output of bureaucratic prose, a discursive practice that is a constant site of struggle over power. in his power stratagem, he believed the pen was mightier than the sword. The power struggle was not just within the movement and its top leadership but also within the wider political frontiers of the colonial state.50 ultimately, this is what defused the violent forest struggle for land and freedom, arresting the momentum of Mau Mau’s militant demand for independence.
