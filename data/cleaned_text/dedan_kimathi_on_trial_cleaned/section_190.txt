That the learned Chief Justice failed to appreciate that, even though a defence of insanity was not open to the appellant, his reactions to his surroundings after being shot and wounded were unlikely to have been normal when judged by african, much less european, standards. 11. That the learned Chief Justice underestimated the importance of the medical evidence establishing that the appellant was an epileptic in considering whether the appellant’s failure to complain was due to his mental condition. 12. That allowing for the fact that it was probably impossible to conduct the appellant’s trial without some reference to his alleged connection with the terrorist organisation known as “Mau Mau” such unnecessary prejudice was caused to the ap- pellant’s defence of lawful excuse in the minds of the assessors by cross examination tending to show that he (the appellant) was the leader of that organisation and by the finding of the learned Chief Justice (incidental though it may have been) that he was in fact a member of that organisation. WHereFore the appellant humbly prays that his appeal be allowed; that his conviction and sentence be set aside and that he be acquitted. DaTeD at nairobi this 21st day of December 1956. (sgd) F.H.
