We carried the prisoner to Kahigaini Homeguard Post. a european police officer arrived there. The pistol was handed to him by Cpl. Wanjohi. i don’t know the european’s name. From the time it was taken from the accused to the time it was handed to the european police officer i did not see it taken out of the holster. The european opened the pistol and i saw him remove 6 rounds of ammunition from it. after that i do not know what happened to the pistol. We carried the prisoner to a motor car. The prisoner’s hair was then wound on top of his head. He then had a beard and a moustache. on that morning when the prisoner was captured i did not at any time hear him say anything about wanting to surrender. adjourned to 2.15 resumed 2.50. (Delay because prisoner complained of being unwell and has been medically examined by three doctors). 15. ndirangu clarifies later in his testimony that what he heard was “Field Marshal.” 16. see exhibit no. 6, pistol, reproduced as figure a.2 in the appendix to this volume. 48 i Document 1 soliCiTor-General: since the adjournment accused complained of being unwell. i wish to call the Provincial Physician as to his state of health. PeTer PerCiVal Turner, sworn, states. M.D., M.r.C.P. Provincial physician. i have just examined accused. Prisoner is complaining of a very severe headache and abnormal noises in his ears. This started 6 a.m. and has got progressively worse. This headache could be connected with his general state: he has been wounded. i found no symptoms. This depends entirely on his story. There is nothing to show for this and i would not expect there to be. i didn’t take his temperature. Whether these symptoms exist or not depends on whether he is telling the truth or not. in my opinion he has a headache such as he describes. He has experienced similar headaches before and he feels that if he were allowed to rest this afternoon, he would be quite well to-morrow. no cross-examination. To Court.
