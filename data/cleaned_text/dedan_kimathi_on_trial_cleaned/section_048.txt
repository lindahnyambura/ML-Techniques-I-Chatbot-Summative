but a close reading of the trial reveals that much of our historical and contemporary knowledge of Kimathi, the internal structure of Mau Mau, and the political legacies of rebellion and counterinsurgency in Kenya are in need of further public and academic reflection. annota- tions have been provided throughout the primary texts to offer points of clarification and context. The audiences for this volume are thus necessar- ily multiple. To put the trial in a broader context, this volume also includes mate- rial related to the trial and several other important documents. The Judg- ment and the appeals for Kimathi’s case provide a lens into how the british colonial justice system interpreted and carried out legal procedures in this very high profile case. The thoroughness of these procedures, as anderson argues in his contribution to this volume, speaks to the recognition of the potential impact of the Kimathi verdict. if one is looking for a Kimathi closer to that of ngũgĩ and Mũgo’s cre- ation, then one might find him more readily in the pages of his interroga- tion. by the end of this report, Kimathi’s interrogator a. D. Dunn reveals his frustration with Kimathi’s unwillingness to give names. Throughout, Kimathi refuses to reveal the true name of his “mistress” and supposed “betrayer.” He refuses to name any of those who participated in the “pas- sive wing” of Mau Mau, those who provided food and support from the reserves. Dunn ends by noting that the “subject is a man of tremendous personality, with a well developed sense of humor, and punctuated his ob- vious lies with a large grin.” but, as anderson and lonsdale point out in their contributions to this volume, the account offered by Kimathi under interrogation deviates significantly from, and even at times contradicts, his testimony before the colonial court. Finally, several key exhibits from the trial and letters written by Kimathi have been included in their original form.
