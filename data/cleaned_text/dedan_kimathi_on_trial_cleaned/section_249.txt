This development had been opposed by the attorney general, John Whyatt, on the grounds that it gave administrative officers (most magistrates were district commissioners or district officers, and hence part of the political service of the government) unwarranted judicial powers.12 but the argument in favor of the extension of powers was driven by the simple fact that the supreme Court was being rapidly overwhelmed by the sheer number of cases, and in november 1952 Mau Mau on Trial i 235 several resident magistrates were temporarily elevated to the role of acting judges in order to deal with the enormous backlog of cases then awaiting trial in the supreme Court.13 in the wake of several murders of europeans on farms in the White Highlands in the early months of 1953—most notoriously the killing of the ruck family, following which the white settlers had angrily protested on the governor’s lawn14—the nairobi government was already preparing to take further steps to speed up the processing of cases by the supreme Court when the lari massacre of 26 March 1953 took place. This slaughter of more than seventy Kikuyu loyalists, most of them women and children, heightened the anxieties of african and european alike and proved to be the catalyst in bringing about a new set of judicial changes. over the next two months steps were taken to extend the death penalty to a wide range of offenses related to Mau Mau insurgent activity—acts of sabotage; the illegal carrying of arms, ammunition, or explosives; consorting with per- sons in possession of arms; the administration of Mau Mau oaths; and the supplying of material aid to insurgents were all now made capital of- fences.15 This went some way to placate the settler clamor for firmer gov- ernment action against the insurgents, but it also threatened to increase further the immense pressures on the supreme Court.
