While Kimathi chaired meetings on the question of women in the forest, penned prohibitions on sexual affairs with female fighters, and was the first to allow women to be promoted in the military ranks, he was also well known for his relations with female fighters, often described in memoirs on both sides as keeping a “harem” of lovers in his company.61 Most famous perhaps was Kimathi’s relationship with his long-term mis- tress in the forest, Wanjiru Wambogo, the only woman in the forest to be awarded the rank of colonel and regarded as the “head of the women and the mother of Mumbi’s children.”62 Kimathi’s confrontations with other generals were legendary. super- intendent Henderson noted that “in the rest of Kenya there were a few africans who could have held their own with Kimathi in council or on the platform. but they were not in the forest and Kimathi was.”63 in the for- est, literacy often became a dividing line among the leadership.64 Kimathi openly criticized the unlettered and they in turn accused Kimathi of hav- ing been poisoned by Christianity and Western education. in March 1955, General stanley Mathenge and his followers broke away from Kimathi’s 12 i Julie MacArthur Kenya Parliament and formed their own association, the Kenya riigi, which translates as the woven door that secured the opening of a Gikuyu household.65 as Peterson has argued, “to riigi critics, the bureaucrats of Kimathi’s Kenya Parliament were untrustworthy. . . . General Kahiu-itina accused Kimathi and other educated Protestant leaders of using their il- literate followers for their own selfish ends.”66 of particular interest in relation to his later trial is the question of Kimathi’s role in and openness to negotiations with the british. in august 1953, Kimathi sent a letter to prominent politician W. W. W. awori to be published in his newspaper Habari za dunia, which awori published and then turned over to the colonial police Criminal investigation Depart- ment (CiD).
