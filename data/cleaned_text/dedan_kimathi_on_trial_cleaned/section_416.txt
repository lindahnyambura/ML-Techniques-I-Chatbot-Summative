There are veiled references elsewhere (the exhibit on trade union struggle is particularly good, but from observation it is bypassed by many visitors; schoolchildren in particular are whisked past at great speed)—for exam- ple, mentions of “prominent chiefs” like luka and “africans who would see to it that the interests of the colonial government were protected.” The Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 355 role of Jomo Kenyatta in Mau Mau (if any) is not made at all clear; he barely features in this space.98 it is important to note two major differences between state and non- state museum displays on Mau Mau: guns are not on display at peace museums—though agikuyu Peace Museum, nyeri, has a corner devoted to liberation struggle, featuring a faded photocopied image of Kimathi.99 neither is there any tone of triumphalism in this latter space, whereas it is palpable in the History of Kenya exhibition.100 The centrality of Gikuyu in the “armed struggle” space can partly be explained by the reported difficulty that exhibition developers had in finding tangible, displayable evidence of the role played by other communities in liberation struggle, and the influence of Gikuyu staff, who from observation relied heavily on elkins’s 2005 book, which centers almost exclusively on Gikuyu involve- ment in Mau Mau.101 elsewhere in the history exhibition, in a display on african responses to colonial conquest, there is a problematic binary op- position of “collaborators” versus “resisters,” which reinforces a simplistic theme common in school textbooks. “in labeling one ethnic community ‘bad’ (for allegedly collaborating with the colonialists), and another ‘good’ (they resisted), a particular construction of moral ethnicity is permanently concretised.”102 This in itself is a powerful contributor to national mem- ory making.
