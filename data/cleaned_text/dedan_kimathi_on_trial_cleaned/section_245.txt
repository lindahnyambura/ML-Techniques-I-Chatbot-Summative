Critical Essays 1 Mau Mau on Trial Dedan Kimathi’s Prosecution and Kenya’s Colonial Justice David M. Anderson The trial of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi has been vividly portrayed by Kenyan authors as political theater1 and as revolutionary rhetoric,2 yet it has featured only fleetingly in the historical retelling of Kenya’s struggle to be free from colonialism.3 Dedan Kimathi is the leading heroic figure in Kenya’s national narrative. as ali Mazrui reminded us long ago, all na- tional histories must have their heroes, but heroes are more easily made the less we know about them.4 so it is that Kimathi’s heroism has been made in an imagined nationalism, and not in the real world of historical events, human relationships, and personal struggles.
