He now says that that is what he was doing.” it is submitted that this is a misdirection in so far as it applies to your Petitioner’s alleged omission to state his defence when charged. it is further submitted that the Chief Justice erred in drawing an inference adverse to your Petition from an omission of your Petitioner to state to his captors that he was coming in to surrender (assuming that such omission was proved). 10. THaT the learned Chief Justice in his Judgment commented upon the evidence of ndirangu regarding the circumstances in which he shot your Petitioner, as follows:- “if ndirangu’s account was true, the accused must have been circling round to get back into the trench he had 166 i Document 4 just left and in which his assailants were. This seemed intrinsically improbable. i thought it possible that ndi- rangu’s third shot did not hit the accused, and that he was shot under the castor oil bush where he had taken cover: that ndirangu having searched and found him and heard who he was, and knowing that he might well be armed, shot him in the leg to make quite sure that he did not run away again; and that ndirangu and those of the other members of the party who might know of this were afraid to say so. ndirangu’s account of the wound- ing of the accused was not supported by njogi who first gave an account of how the man was shot in the trench and afterwards corrected this and said he had not clearly seen the accused when ndirangu fired the third shot. The exact circumstances in which the accused came to be wounded are not in themselves at issue in the case. They are important, but important only to the extent that they affect the credibility of the witnesses and the answers to the issues which i have set out above.
