This may have been due to language difficulties, but it may also indicate that many accused were resigned to their fate, believing that the court would find them guilty come what may. That impression may have been largely substantiated for the accused by the way in which the court treated certain kinds of evidence. This related to amendments made to the evidence act under emergency regulations. special emergency assizes cases were frequently characterized by allega- tions of the mistreatment and especially beatings of prisoners. accused persons commonly claimed to have been beaten when arrested, and again (often repeatedly) during interrogations. Those coming before the court frequently bore the physical scars of these attacks. extrajudicial statements gathered during the questioning of prisoners in Mau Mau cases often as- sembled evidence that amounted to a full confession; but if such state- ments had been gained under duress, then they would not be admissible in court. The court could accept such statements in evidence only if they had been made before either a magistrate or a senior (european) police officer. The extension of this power to senior police officers was the critical factor, this amendment being introduced as yet another way to relieve the burden on magistrates as the press of legal work caused by the insurrection built up. This had been firmly opposed by the attorney general, who rightly pointed to the dangers of an arresting officer being responsible for attest- ing what might amount to a confession that would condemn the prisoner.
