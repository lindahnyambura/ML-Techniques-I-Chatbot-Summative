He admits having made Judgment i 145 the reply to the charge which is recorded, but says that he was then very ill: his leg was paining very much, he had not yet passed water or otherwise relieved himself since he left the forest: he could hear noises in his ears and was feeling giddy. The accused says that when he replied that he never knew that there was such a law, what he wished to say was that he did not know that there was such a law for a person who was coming in to surrender himself: he thought he had completed the sentence and had said that: he only spoke a few words and was unable to say more because he was in pain. The accused says that when asP Vidler later visited him, he was in civilian clothes and the accused did not know that he was a police officer. He said nothing to the Magistrate about surrender because he thought he was the judge and it might be improper. The accused says that he has mentioned the question of surrender to europeans of his escort; but the Defence did not call any of them to substantiate this. The accused says that he has suffered from epileptic fits since he was a child and he called his mother and one-Joseph Wakaba to support this. Dr Turner, the Provincial Physician also says that the accused is an epileptic and he says that anesthesia and operations are a well known precipitating cause of fits, an epileptic may have a fit as a result of an anesthetic and an operation. This would not be noticed if it occurred during anesthesia. if an epileptic had a fit during anesthesia, it would be likely that he would have a severe headache and mental blurring for some hours after he recovered consciousness. These symptoms might last up to 48 hours. There is no evidence that he did in fact have a fit. There is no defence of insanity in this case.
