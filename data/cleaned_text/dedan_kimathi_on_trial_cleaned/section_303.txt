Finally, on their capture or surrender in the later stages of the war many itungati decided to turn their coat and return into the trees as “pseudogangsters” under british command. These were the men who, increasingly on their own initiative, closed the net on Kimathi. re- sentment of the forest leadership was among their motives. Mau Mau was demoralized by the acrimonious debates that Kimathi put on trial—but not, it must be remembered, before the movement had suffered casual- ties heavier than any regular army could have sustained. There were prob- ably up to twenty thousand forest insurgents at the height of Mau Mau’s strength in early 1954; by late 1956, the time of Kimathi’s trial, they had lost nearly seventeen thousand dead, captured, and surrendered, most of them killed in action.83 Mau Mau’s Debates on Trial i 275 Mau Mau’s forest debates echoed those of the Gikuyu as a whole, in pitting the daily diplomacy of sovereign households against the unbending arrogance of institutional rules. nor were these Gikuyu anxieties alone. The disputed conduct of their forest insurgency, however unique in its particular context in colonial history, raises questions of freedom, order, and authority of concern to us all. Thirty years ago, in the late 1980s, ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o asked, from his swedish exile, “Why is history subversive?” it was a good question to pose in his foreword to Maina wa Kinyatti’s edition of The Dedan Kimathi Papers.84 ngũgĩ’s answer was that history tells, or should tell, both of hu- manity’s common struggle against nature and of our internal battles to secure a just reward for all those who sweat at that task. He went on to argue that these struggles are what propel progressive social change. Most historians would agree. That is one reason why history is subver- sive, why it terrifies tyrants, why they try to rewrite it as a praise-song in which their sovereign will, not social struggle, is the motor of improve- ment.
