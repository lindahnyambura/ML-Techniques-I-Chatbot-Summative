Clough has written, “Mau Mau is difficult to assimilate into the useable historical memory” for reasons that include its violence, ethnic composition, and regional nature, and the disparity between its original ideals and the sorry state of postindependence Kenya and citizens’ betrayal by successive po- litical elites.125 lonsdale has also discussed the usability of such memory, in the context of internecine violence and the “poisoned national memory of ethnic competition” to which Mau Mau has contributed.126 at the end of the day, the exclusivity of a “story” that marginalizes or silences the majority of other Kenyans remains a major impediment to the usability of Mau Mau memory in public national history. apart from two monuments and a puzzling “armed struggle” exhibit at the nairobi national Museum, none of which is inclusive of all who were affected by the emergency, we Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 359 are left with the haunting image of Kimathi in the dock, silently accusing his accusers. it is just as well there is no surviving soundtrack in Kimathi’s own words, describing his personal struggle within a struggle toward the end of his life, for that would bring nuance, complexity, and contradic- tion—which is more than Mau Mau memorialization can bear. Notes 1. Macarthur, in the introduction to this volume, briefly discusses these images, opining that the stretcher image depicts Kimathi “as if a subdued ani- mal or helpless infant.” she reproduces the uncropped courtroom image in her online article “The Hunt for (the Trial of Dedan Kimathi),” Africa Is a Country, 24 March 2016. This image reveals that he was in fact draped in blankets from the waist down, which are not visible in the cropped image. she, too, notes that his bunched dreadlocks look like horns here (see photos 2 and 3). Here Kimathi has been stripped of the leopard-skin coat and hat, leather jerkin, and other clothes he was wearing when captured.
