That having regard to the fact that a reward had been pub- licly offered for the capture of the appellant and to the fact that this reward was paid to the various prosecution wit- nesses alleged to have taken part in that “capture” after state- ments had been taken from such witnesses and before they gave evidence, there was a grave reason to suspect that such statements may have been induced and that such evidence may have been influenced by this reward. 4. That the learned Chief Justice having for good reason reject- ed or at least doubted the evidence of the Chief Prosecution Witness, ndirangu Mau, on a matter material to the question depending before him i.e. the exact circumstances in which the appellant was shot and wounded, erred in accepting the uncorroborated evidence of that witness that the appellant had not, before he was shot, raised his arms and said “it is i, Dedan Kimathi. i have come to surrender. Don’t kill me. i have a pistol”. 5. That the learned Chief Justice misdirected the assessors by repeatedly emphasising the failure of the appellant to put forward his defence of lawful excuse until his trial and by impliedly inviting them to infer therefrom that the appellant had no such lawful excuse. 6. That the learned Chief Justice erred in considering the ap- pellant’s omission to complain as more or less conclusive of the fact that he had not been shot while trying to surrender. 7. That the learned Chief Justice misdirected the assessors in law by inviting them to infer that the appellant was not intending to surrender because he had not so stated when charged before a magistrate on the 22nd of october, 1956. 8. That the learned Chief Justice misdirected himself in law by drawing as against the appellant an adverse inference by rea- son of the latter’s omission to make an exculpatory statement when charged by superintendent baker, and further, misdi- rected the assessors by inviting them to draw a like inference.
