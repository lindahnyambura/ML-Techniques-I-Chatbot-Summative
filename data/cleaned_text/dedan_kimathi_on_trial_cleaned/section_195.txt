He crossed what is variously described as a stream or a dry river bed, traversing the trench. (This turned out, on examination by the witness who made a map of the scene, to be a steep dip in the trench at which there were traces of erosion as if water had at some time passed over the trench) on the further side of this dip the trench slopes up steeply. according to ndirangu the man ran some way up this slope and got on top of the bank of the trench on the reserve side, which is there only about a foot high. ndirangu says that he (ndirangu) was then down below on one side of the “stream” (presumably in the dip) and that the fugitive was on higher ground on the other side of the “stream”: the man climbed out of the trench on the reserve side, but was curving round running to come back to it again when ndirangu knelt and fired a third shot at him. He staggered and disappeared on the reserve Appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom i 159 side of the trench. ndirangu and njogi went to the spot where they had last seen the fugitive. There was no sign of him. njogi remained there. ndirangu started to search. “The two tribal police reservists from the next post, Mwangi s/o Kanguru (not sergeant Mwangi) and Maina, arrived, attracted by the shooting. “after searching for some time, variously estimated at one hour and 20 minutes, (estimates of times and distances by illiterate african witnesses are usually quite unreliable) ndirangu says that he saw a thing like a leopard lying in some undergrowth under a small castor oil tree or bush. He saw that it was a man wearing a leopard skin coat and cap. ndirangu said to the man “Who are you?” He replied “it is i Kimathi s/o Wachiuri”. ndirangu said “What about the other name?”. The man replied “i am called Dedan Kimathi”: he also mentioned something sounding like “Field Marshal”. ndirangu told him to come out. He said he could not, as ndirangu had shot him. ndirangu insisted on his crawling out, which he did.
