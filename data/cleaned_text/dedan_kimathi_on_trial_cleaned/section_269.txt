The grim irony of this discussion, and a matter that was not indicated in the court proceedings, and has only become apparent with the release in 2012 of additional british documents on the Kenyan emergency,51 is that it was precisely letters that Kimathi had written to the government during 1953 that had promoted the first surrender offer to be framed.52 The surrender leaflet issued on 24 august 1953 was authorized by a meet- ing at Government House four days earlier that “was called to consider the implementation of a general surrender policy in view of the attached two communications which had been received from Dedan Kimathi.”53 The letters prompting the 1953 surrender offer were thus sent more than six months before the earliest of Kimathi’s letters referred to in the court- room, the first of which dates to March 1954, and are therefore almost certainly the letters Kimathi himself mentions in this 1954 correspondence as not having been replied to. Mau Mau on Trial i 249 Justice o’Connor’s summing up in this case is among the longest and most thorough in any special emergency assize hearing where just a sin- gle accused stood in the dock. Dismissing the epilepsy claim as largely ir- relevant, the bulk of his comments deal with the issue of whether Kimathi’s claim to have been surrendering was credible. With one eye firmly on the appeals court and the other on the assessors sitting in front of him, o’Connor’s summing up skillfully blocked off any possible angle from which a further plea might be made, carefully weighing each of the points favoring and against Kimathi’s defense. Though the opinions of the asses- sors need have no impact on o’Connor’s judgment, the government would have been greatly embarrassed, and open to criticism, had the Kikuyu as- sessors dissented from the view of the court and suggested that Kimathi should go free or that clemency be shown. in the event, their comments gave the british no cause for concern.
