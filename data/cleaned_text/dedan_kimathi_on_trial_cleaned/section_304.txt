We must always be critical of our sources, whether written or oral. They each tell their own, self-interested, story of the past; we must never take them at their word. but we must be self-critical as well, wary of our own stories since history, as bethwell ogot once advised us, is nothing if not a discipline of context.85 but two contexts affect the way we write history and they tend to conflict. on one hand there is our own story: our present-day context cannot help but influence the historian’s choice of the problems she or he wants to research, which witnesses to summon, and what ques- tions to ask them. The other context is the past itself, that foreign country where they act and think differently from in the historian’s own day. in the first context, we historians run the risk of creating a past that is interesting or useful to us today. but the past we thereby neglect or suppress—how- ever unwittingly—may well have been the more important for those who lived it. and it is more complicated than that since there are always many 276 i John M.
