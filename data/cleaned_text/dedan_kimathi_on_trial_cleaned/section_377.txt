Then i would outlive their malice, return to an independent country and live in freedom and dignity.38 in this soliloquy, the contradictory moments that define Kimathi come together in unexpected ways: We have Kimathi bemoaning his fate (“The british hunt me down relentlessly / To send me to the gallows”) and also imagining his possible return to “an independent country” where he can live “in freedom and dignity.” but whom does Kimathi address here? To the extent that this is a so- liloquy, we could say that he is speaking to himself. Within the fiction of the stage, however, he is directly addressing an audience that already knows his fate and for whom the questions that he raises are about the Dedan Kimathi: The Floating Signifier and the Missing Body i 327 present rather than the past. Moreover, within the moment of production of the play (1974), Kimathi is the embodied absence that asks some of the questions troubling the Kenyan audience: what is the meaning of free- dom? What would it mean for one to live in an “independent country” in “freedom and dignity”? in mourning Kimathi—the absent one—the ideals for which he stood are articulated at the same time as their imminent and immanent betrayal is bemoaned: 1st scout (in terror): The sacred tree! The sacred tree! Kimathi has been arrested! rhino: our land! all Freedom!39 The lesson of Watene’s play is that the meaning of Kimathi’s name in the present—and thus the fate of the narrative of postcoloniality—can only be learned from his failure. The Performance of Ambivalence The idea that it is only in his suffering and defeat that Kimathi can be- come a conduit for the aspirations and anxieties of Kenyans in the 1970s is not one that will satisfy the Kenyan left, a group already engaged in what will turn out to be a deadly struggle with the postcolonial state.
