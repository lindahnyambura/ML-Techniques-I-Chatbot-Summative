He did not indicate that he had information and would not give it. The impression that the accused gave me was that he could assist me in giving information, but he was obstinate and would not do so. That was my impression. it is correct that he has made no complaint that he was shot when he came in to surrender. i do not know whether he has ever been asked by anyone as to the circumstances. re-eXaMineD: i am a C.i.D. officer. i know the Judges rules.26 a prisoner in custody must be cautioned before he is asked questions and i would not ask further questions about the circumstances in which he was arrested unless he volunteers information. 26. The “Judges’ rules” are a “code of procedure drafted by the judges to aid the police when they question suspects.” G. l. Peiris, “The admissibility of evidence obtained illegally: a Comparative analysis,” Ottawa Law Review 13, no. 2 (1981): 309–44. in 1956, these rules, of practice rather than law, included cautioning suspects or persons in custody before proceeding with questions, informing suspects of their right not to speak, and taking down any state- ments in writing and having them signed by the suspect after having been read and allowed to make corrections to the statement. Hardinge stanley Giffard, The Laws of England Vol. 10 (london: butterworth, 1955), 470–73. The “Judges’ rules” have particular significance in relation to the admissibility of interro- gation reports as evidence: the main concern of interrogations “was to secure information about insurgent plans and organizations, not to gather evidence to prosecute individuals. Consequently they did not conduct interrogations under judges’ rules and so statements obtained during their interrogations were not admissible as evidence in a court of law.” David French, The British Way in Counter-insurgency, 1945–1967 (oxford: oxford university Press, 2011), 89.
