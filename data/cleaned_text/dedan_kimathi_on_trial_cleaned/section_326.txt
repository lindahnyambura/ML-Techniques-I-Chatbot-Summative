but the highest honor paid to him was by the nyeri elite led by Mwai Kibaki, who in 1972 established the Dedan Kimathi university of Technology.30 after ascending to the presidency, Kibaki took the memorialization of Kim- mathi a notch higher by commissioning the Kimathi statue that stands at the head of the street named after him at the center of the country’s politi- cal and commercial capital, nairobi.31 all this came at a time when Kenyans were witnessing a distantly re- lated reincarnation of Mau Mau, the growing Mungiki movement among Gikuyu rural and urban youth.32 This then is what explains why, in an intimate conversation, in 2006 with two close friends from my church in nairobi, one concerned observer expressed fear that the Kimathi statue would send the “wrong” message in the country and signal “the return of his spirit.” Whatever that might have meant, it was not far from the truth.33 in my belated rejoinder to my friend’s remark and, appropriately using biblical imagery, this recognition that came late in the day, was Kimathi’s haunting blood bitterly crying out to be remembered, and for justice, from an unmarked grave. His voice joined at least a thousand others whose micronarratives are effectively detailed by anderson’s Histories of the Hanged and thus continue providing witness to british colonial po- litical oppression, exploitation, injustice, and police and military brutal- ity from their graves. This moment in Mau Mau history in general, and the commemoration of Kimathi in particular, marked the zenith of the retrieval from near oblivion of one of the most violent periods in Kenya’s history that a few would rather not remember.
