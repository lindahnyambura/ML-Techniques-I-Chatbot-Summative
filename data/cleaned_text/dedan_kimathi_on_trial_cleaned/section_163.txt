also ndirangu said he was kneeling and he says that the accused was running and was on top of the bank of the trench (which bank is there only a foot or so high) on the reserve side. if ndirangu’s story is true – we do not know exactly where on the bank of the trench the accused was when he was hit – (he says under the castor oil bush) ndirangu says on top of the trench. if the accused was on top of the trench opposite the castor oil tree he would not be above ndirangu because the trench slopes down to that point. opposite the castor oil tree is in fact the lowest point of the trench. ndirangu could be approximately level with the accused if both were on the 30 yards or so of flat ground at the lowest part of the trench. if, however, the accused had climbed the slope beyond the lowest point and had got some way up it (as ndirangu says) he could be above ndirangu when he was hit, and he might have then crawled or rolled back down the hill just inside the reserve to the castor oil tree. it is said that that tree provided the best hiding place on that side of the trench in that vicinity so he may have made for it. except in so far as it affects the credit of the witnesses the question of precisely how the accused was wounded is not an issue in the case. The main issue is: Was the accused coming in to surrender and bringing his weapons for that purpose? How Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 129 he came to be wounded is not an issue on Count 1 or Count 2 and is important but is only important in so far as it affects the credibility of the witnesses and whether their stories are true or not. you may think, (i am not suggesting that you should), that the accused was shot under the castor oil tree. you would still have to consider whether he was there because he was trying to surrender as he says. or you may believe all that ndirangu says, backed up as he is by the other tribal policemen. you may think that the fugitive was shot on the side of the trench as ndirangu describes.
