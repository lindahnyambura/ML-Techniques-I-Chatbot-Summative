The exit wound would not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the bullet. i made a careful examination of the wound and took an x-ray photo which i have here. The point of entry was below the point on the thigh bone which was struck by the bullet. it would be a correct deduction that the bullet was travelling upwards. on an x-ray film i mark the point of entry as point a. The place where it struck the bone i mark b, which is 11⁄2” higher. X-ray film tendered (exhibit a).28 That assumes that the man was standing up when shot. That bullet could not have been fired by a man who was behind a man who was running away from him. i think the bullet could 28. see exhibit no. a, X-ray photograph of Kimathi’s bullet wound to the thigh, reproduced as figure a.3 in the appendix to this volume. 80 i Document 1 not have been fired from the right side at 90° from the direction the man was facing. it could have been fired by a person on his left side. ∅ note. i should say the shot was fired from below and very nearly answer 90° - 75° - to the man’s left front.∅ That assumes that he was read back standing or running, but if he were squatting with the thigh and con- rotated outwards, the shot could have come from more to his firmed.

Q. if a person were squatting with his knees open and if a person fired at him from a little below and from his left front, would that explain entirely the nature of this wound. a. it would. i would say that that wound would cause considerable pain. on the Monday morning when Mr. baker saw him he was still suffering pain. That might have affected the ability to give precise replies to questions; but i thought that it would not in the particular case of this patient. i did not specifically ask him whether he was suffering from any head pains. it might take another two months before the patient makes a full recovery from his wound. re-eXaMineD. on the Monday morning – he had stood the operation very well. i asked him how he was.
