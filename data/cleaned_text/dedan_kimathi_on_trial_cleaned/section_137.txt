it is a disease which sometimes affects the mind. Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 105 Q. is it always possible in the earlier stages of this disease to detect deterioration of the mind? a. no. it would not be possible unless one knew the person personally and knew the person over a long period of time. it would be easier for a relative than for me examining him over a short period of time. it could be detected in ordinary conversation if it were advanced. otherwise, it could only be detected by some overt abnormal act. inasmuch as anaesthesia and operations are a well known precipitating cause of a fit it can be said that an epileptic may have a fit brought on by these occurrences. if a fit occurred during anaesthesia it would not be noticed. if the epileptic has a fit under anaesthesia, he would be likely to have a severe headache and mental blurring for some hours after he recovers consciousness.
