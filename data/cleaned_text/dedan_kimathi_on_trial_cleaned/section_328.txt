it is crucial to examine the constitution and inner dynamics of resistance as exemplified by Kimathi, including the formation of his personal identity or how he “imagined him- self as a leader of a new polity of citizens of an ordered, lawful, and pro- gressive society.”36 in an attempt to shed light on this historical figure, i rely on Foucault’s proposition that power and resistance are almost inescap- ably and dialectically linked. and the idea that resistance should be seen as the “efficacious influence” of those subordinate to power.37 among many other useful insights of Foucauldian analysis of power and resistance are two important conceptions. one is that resistance, like legitimacy, is a kind of governance. second, the idea that the process through which existing forms of government are addressed by the gov- erned, referred to as “protogovernmentalization,” is rooted in what people know. From the second notion follows the fact, usually taken for granted, that the power/knowledge nexus is central to understanding the inner dynamics or workings of power. The centrality of the power/knowledge The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 293 nexus suggests that the conception of knowledge is the most promising fulcrum around which to articulate the relation of power, resistance, and government. Put differently, that both government and resistance work on and through knowledge, and that forms of social relations can be con- ceived of in terms of an ever-widening circle from self through individual freedom fighters, to “solidaristic others,” and to “generalized others.” Fur- ther, each of these may be thought of as constitutive aspects of the identity of a subject.38 Following this Foucauldian-premised formula, i posit that we can identify at least four constitutive positions and inner dynamics of Kimathi’s resistance, the first three of which were efficacious.
