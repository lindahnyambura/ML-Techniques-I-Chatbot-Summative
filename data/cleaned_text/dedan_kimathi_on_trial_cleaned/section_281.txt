in bringing his arms with him, moreover, he was simply complying with the terms of the government’s surrender offers.4 He had told the TPs of his intention to surrender and of his gun but had been too shocked and sick to repeat this statement when questioned in hospital by a white police officer; he suffered from what Gikuyu called “devils,” what whites called epilepsy.5 Conroy pressed Kimathi further. Had he really broken with Mau Mau all that time ago? Had he not written to the government, months after the alleged split, under such grand titles as Field Marshal, Knight of the east african empire, and President of the Kenya Parliament and land Freedom army?6 Did this not prove he was still in command? Kimathi disagreed. His followers had promoted him, not he himself, so he did not know how important his ranks were, whether “top or bottom or middle.” Moreover, in his letter of 27 March 1954 (exhibit no. 23) he had written not as a commander but as “an intermediary—between. . . . i did write that letter with the intention of getting peace but i was not on either side. . . . i was afraid of Mau Mau and have been ever since.”7 in that case, why, asked Conroy, did he take so long to “come in” and surrender?8 Kimathi explained: it was dangerous, some fighters had been shot in the attempt. it was riskier still for him; there was a price on his Mau Mau’s Debates on Trial i 259 head—Ksh 10,000, or £500.9 Members of the security forces might think it easier to secure that reward by killing rather than capturing him (as perhaps ndirangu had tried?). it was not until he was sick, deserted, and hunted on all sides that he had decided to take his chance. Without this “change of heart” he could well have continued to hide in the vastness of the nyandarua or aberdare forests. Kimathi had to convince three assessors, fellow Gikuyu and the chief justice sir Kenneth o’Connor, a Protestant irishman and indian army veteran of the First World War.
