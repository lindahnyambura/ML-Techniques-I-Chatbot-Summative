22A—Official English Translation of Kimathi Letter i 203 (9) The Kenya Parliament is of the opinion91 that after a few years a great war may occur which will effect Kenya and in this war there will be no choice between black and white therefore we of Kenya – blacks and Whites – should be of one heart and have a common desire to end this war and return our clothes.92 if the father of the son is pressed, the son helps the father naturally. There have been emergencies before in british countries,93 even wars over religion such as the 80 years War and those of europe during the era of the yeomans. We have learned.94 We should finish this war so that it goes to posterity.95 (10) in Kenya and most of east africa war is inevitable unless jus- tice is done and use is made of the truth. if some races do not relax the pressure they have put on other races, there is every chance of great future troubles.96 if there is no way of peacefully ending the present struggle in Kenya, is it not most likely that this struggle will continue up to the time of a world war. all races in Kenya are affected by the situation. Truth and fairness is not a product of the gun.97 Justice breaks a tied bow98 as a 91. in the original the Kenya Parliament is “certain,” not “of the opinion.” 92. The phraseology is unclear here, and it is possible that the writer is in fact calling for the return of clothing. read in this way, the phrase would say “and us in Kenya, white or black, it is better to be in a common accord, we put back the clothes, for if the father is captured the son will free him, and he will help the father in all matters.” but it seems unlikely that clothing would have been so much on Dedan Kimathi’s mind. it is likely that instead of “twĩcokie nguo” (we put back the clothes) Kimathi meant to write “twĩcokie ngoro” (we mutually assist ourselves). 93. The original says “There has been an emergency even in britain.” The word “emergency” is given in english. 94.
