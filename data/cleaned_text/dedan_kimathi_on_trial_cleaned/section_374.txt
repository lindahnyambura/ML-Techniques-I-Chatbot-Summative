The question of motivation seems to haunt Watene’s work: why does the playwright who, like many members of his generation, had suffered under the state of emergency provide us with a figure of Kimathi that rehearses the colonial version of the Mau Mau leader? Why does he rely on colonial sources such as ian Henderson’s book The Hunt for Dedan Kimathi? The most obvious responses to these questions would appear to be ideological rather than aesthetic—that Watene, either willfully or as a form of false consciousness, sets out to reproduce a settler-friendly image of Kimathi.30 My view is more charitable: rather than being a victim or beneficiary of colonialist ideologies, Watene, like his friend and classmate sam Ka- higa, is struggling to figure out what Mau Mau was all about and to locate Kimathi at the center of what had hitherto been an unspeakable history, a violent history that they had lived through as adolescents.31 The more urgent question is this: why does Watene need to imagine Dedan Kimathi in 1974, ten years after independence and well after the publication of a series of fictions and memoirs that make Mau Mau more visible in public discourse? What is at issue in this recalling of the name of Kimathi when the business of the past seems to have been officially settled? answers to this question can best be gleaned from the views of two characters, forest fighters in the play, who see their primary duty as the protection of “the dignity of Kimathi” and the protection of “his name from destruction.”32 The forest fighters imagine a future in which the name of Kimathi will come to stand in for a heroic movement, a period when “the general mass of the people / Will give honor to the deserving / as is the wont of historical justice.”33 Whatever he does, Kimathi’s reputation must be protected at all costs. but why and from whom does the name of Kimathi need to be protected? Why does his memory need to be se- cured for the future?
