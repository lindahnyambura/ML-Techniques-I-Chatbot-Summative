Truth may emerge from this process, but truth it is not the primarily goal of either the prosecuting or the defense counsel. advocates, along with judges and juries, consider only the evidence laid before the court, being explicitly instructed to ig- nore other factors. Historians, by contrast, have the advantage of being able to trian- gulate other kinds of evidence, from beyond the courtroom, in order to come to judgments. This may not necessarily bring historians any closer to truth than courtroom advocates can manage, but it does allow for a rather different “balancing of evidence.” Dedan Kimathi’s interrogation presents evidence that was not offered to the court but that historians must weigh against the arguments made before Justice o’Connor by Conroy and Miller, respectively. if we assume that the interrogation is accurate, reflecting what Kimathi actually said to the special branch officer Dunn on 31 october 1956, then it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Miller’s defense of Kimathi was constructed entirely post hoc, designed purpose- fully as a legal strategy that might succeed in sowing sufficient doubt in the mind of the judge so as to avoid a capital sentence. There is, accordingly, reason to doubt that Kimathi intended to surrender when shot by Tribal Policeman ndirangu, and, moreover, reason to doubt that his epilepsy— though genuine enough as a condition from which he suffered and one that might well have had a strong influence on his behavior at times in the forest—had any bearing on the circumstances of his capture, questioning, interrogation, or trial. The circumstance of Kimathi’s capture was also only partially revealed in the courtroom. by october 1956, Kimathi was being hunted in the nyan- darua forest by a security team under the direction of special branch offi- cer ian Henderson.
