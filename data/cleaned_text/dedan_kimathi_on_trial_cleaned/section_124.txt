s.G. i object to this evidence of letters. Govt. denies that there are any. The proper course is to call for any letters of this kind and if they are refused, secondary evidence can be given of them. The object of this is to produce an impression that  wished to surrender. That the Crown contests. any letters that there are have been produced to Counsel for the Defence. They are available and can be produced, subject to objection as to relevance. Miller: i have read them all. rulinG: if Defence Counsel wishes to have any of these letters produced he should call for it, and it can be put in subject to any objection to its relevance. secondary evidence of its contents is not admis- sible while the original is available to speak for itself. Miller: Discusses with accused whether he wishes to call for those letters. i shall not call for those letters. WiTness: My two reasons for not coming in before were (1) because i was afraid of being killed and (2) was awaiting replies to certain letters i had sent to Govern- ment. a. My reason for eventually coming in was because the forest peo- ple (commonly known as Mau Mau) and the security Forces were hunting me and at this time, i was left all alone and i was ill. i said to myself: “it is better to come out either to be killed, 92 i Document 1 or if i am lucky to get to the Government.” My intention was to surrender and to give the pistol and the ammunition to the Government according to the instructions which i knew. i made up my mind to come out on the 20th october, 1956. after making up my mind i started and it got night before i arrived in the reserve. i arrived in the reserve about 7.30 p.m. it was moonlight. i was afraid to go to any of the homeguard posts because i realised that i would be shot and had no light with me. being hungry i went to find some kind of food. i went along the shambas. i passed through banana plants and through a shamba  maize. The maize was ripe – also sugar cane.
