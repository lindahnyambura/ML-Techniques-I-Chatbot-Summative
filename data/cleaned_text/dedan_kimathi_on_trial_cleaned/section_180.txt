The first still stands. The leaflet upon which the accused relies (ex C) says inter alia: “all those who have not committed murder are noW given a chance to save their lives. Decide quickly what to do, to come in and surrender.... if possible, come with your arms. you can surrender to any european officer or to any other Government representative”. The accused was asked why, if he was relying on this leaflet dated august, 1953, he did not come in to surrender before october, 1956. He replied that this was because (1) there was a large reward offered for him and he was afraid that Tribal Police or Home Guards would shoot him to get the money and (2) he was awaiting replies to certain letters which he had sent to Government. The defence were offered production of these letters, subject to objection as to their relevance, but declined to call for them. The accused said that his reason for eventually coming in was because the Mau Mau and the security forces were hunting him: at that time he was left all alone and he was ill. “i said it is better to go out either to be killed or, if i am lucky, to get to the Government”. He said that his intention was to surrender and to give the pistol and the ammunition to the Government according to the instructions which he knew. The accused said that he made up his mind on the 20th october to surrender. He started: night fell before he got to the reserve. He 144 i Document 2 arrived in the reserve about 7.30 pm: he was afraid to go to any of the Home Guard Posts, for fear that he would be shot. being hungry, he went to find food and got some sugar cane and four maize cobs. He roasted his maize at a fire. Day broke before he had eaten. He began to walk towards the Kahigaini road. He was down in the valley and went up to the trench as the most convenient route to the road. He was in the trench about 150 yards from the main road.
