The first was dated 6th March 1954 in one place and 6th april 1954 in another. accused admits it is in his handwriting. it is addressed to the Deputy Governor, sir F. Crawford and it contains a passage: “i on behalf of all my followers and the Defence Council and as President of the Council and Knight Commander of the african empire and Commander in Chief of the Country of Kenya notify that the terms will not be considered etc...” He signs as “F.M. sir D. Kimathi K.C.a.e. and supreme C-in-C of the Country of Kenya and land Federation {sic} armies”. That is what he wrote then. He now says that those had previously been his titles, but that as from February, 1954, he only had five followers. you will consider whether he is a truthful witness. The second letter is dated 30/3/54. it is addressed to the ag. Governor and signed “Field Marshal sir D. KiMaTHi” and 132 i Document 1 contains among other things the sentence: “once i shout peace, there is never a war in Kenya”. you must consider whether that was likely to have been written by a man whose associates had already turned from him – all but five – and who needed a revolver for the sole purpose of protecting himself from them. The third letter is dated 20/10/1954. it purports to come from “The Kenya Parliament The land Freedom armies G.H.Q.” and is addressed to the Kenya Government. it urges the restoration of peace and is signed by the accused as “Field Marshal sir D. Kimathi President for and on behalf of the Kenya Parliament”. That is dated about 8 months after February 1954 when, according to what accused now says, he split away from the other leaders and Mau Mau and went away with five companions and was given a revolver solely for the purpose of protecting himself from Mau Mau. He says that he knew about the surrender leaflets. He didn’t come in before because as there was a reward of shs. 10,000 offered for him he was afraid of being killed by police or Home Guards in order to get the money.
