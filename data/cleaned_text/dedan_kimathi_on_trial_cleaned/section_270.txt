The first assessor, Tumuti Gakere, asserted that Kimathi had come out of the forest to collect food, and not to surrender, and that he had every intention of going back into the for- est when he was captured. The second assessor, nderitu Muteru, declared his faith in the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses, dismissed Kimathi’s surrender claim, and stated that he believed that the pistol and ammunition belonged to Kimathi. Finally, Kibuthu Kihia, making refer- ence to the terms of the 1953 surrender offer, declared, “if his intention was to come out to surrender, he ought to have had a big bunch of green branches. Therefore i say he is guilty: he is a gangster.”54 o’Connor’s final judgment in the case left no room for doubt that Kimathi was guilty as charged, and the death sentence was passed. The verdict against Kimathi was challenged in the east african Court of appeal but was summarily dismissed on 27 December 1956.55 The case then went to the Privy Council.56 There, Kimathi was repre- sented by Dingle Foot, the british barrister who had saved the Koin- ange’s from the gallows when they stood accused of involvement in the murder of senior Chief Waruhiu.57 but even the optimistic Foot must have realized that the path to the Privy Council was opened only to ensure there could be no accusations leveled at the british of hav- ing restricted Kimathi’s opportunity to seek justice. With the dismissal of the case by the Privy Council, all possible legal pathways had been exhausted. Dedan Kimathi was executed by hanging on the morning of 18 February 1957. 250 i David M.

The prosecuting and defense counsel construct arguments, assembling evidence in support of their case and seeking to convince the court—whether a single judge or a full jury—of the guilt or innocence of the accused.
