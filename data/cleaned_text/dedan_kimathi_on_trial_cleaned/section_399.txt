young curator Waihenya njoroge, grandson of a Mau Mau fighter who admitted taking part in the first massacre and narrowly escaped the gallows, told me, “our job is to 344 i Lotte Hughes bring healing, and do as Desmond Tutu said: ‘There is no future without forgiveness.’”37 in this regard, the lari Memorial Peace Museum represents a unique reconciliation initiative that has gone further, in its own small way, than any state effort—and deserves greater official recognition. The museum carries out peace education in local schools, worked with fellow peace museums to reconcile warring communities after the 2008 post- election violence, and displays items of material culture symbolizing peace in different ethnic communities, promoting the idea that “traditional” peace cultures can be used to unite and reconcile modern-day Kenyans.38 annie Coombes makes the important point that the museum’s jux- taposition of photographs of massacre victims (many unnamed) and the handwritten list of names of both victims and perpetrators, displayed on a wall nearby, “effectively undoes the intention of the colonial archive” and involves “promiscuous recycling of british propaganda in order to narrate a tale of violence enacted by both sides of the divide.”39 The lists also restore some humanity to otherwise largely unidentified and unidentifiable vic- tims.40 elsewhere, she has argued that the novel way in which the museum uses material culture, oral history, and memories of the emergency “may represent a recognition of a more fragmentary lived experience of both the history of the struggle for independence and its aftermath,” which is not to be found in state museums.41 i have dwelled at some length on lari because it provides a highly instructive case study for understanding the complexity and ambiguity of contemporary memorialization of Mau Mau.
