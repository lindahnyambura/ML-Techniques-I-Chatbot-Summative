For a discussion of hip-hop artists ukoo Flani Mau Mau and other Kenyan rappers, their use of Mau Mau “memory,” and images of Kimathi, see Caroline Mose, “Hip Hop Halisi: Continuities of Heroism on the african Po- litical landscape,” and Mich nyawalo, “redefining the struggle: remember- ing the Mau Mau through Hip Hop Music,” in Hip Hop and Social Change in Africa: Ni wakati, ed. Msia Kibona Clark and Mickie Mwanzia Koster (lan- ham, MD: lexington books, 2014), 3–25, 72–92. nyawalo explores how certain rappers have taken inspiration from Mau Mau freedom songs, “exalt . . . the memory of the nationally mythologized Mau Mau uprising . . . in their ar- tistic performances,” and used it when rapping about the predicament of mar- ginalized youth (73). also see Mwanzia Koster, “The Hip Hop revolution in Kenya: ukoo Flani Mau Mau, youth Politics and Memory, 1990–2012,” Journal of Pan African Studies 6, no. 3 (2013): 82–105. Mwanzia Koster describes ukoo Flani Mau Mau as a “conglomerate” of many different groups rather than a sin- gle group (86). The name is used, according to her informants, to “carry on the anti-colonial Mau Mau struggle” (92). interestingly, in the graffiti art shown in fig. 2 of that article, the artist appears to have amalgamated the stretcher and dock images to show Kimathi with his eyes looking to his right (as in some versions of the stretcher image) but with his moustache, goatee, and visible dreadlocks restored (the dock image). This may be read as an example of the “creative reworking of the colonial archive,” which is thereby “effectively destabilize.” Coombes, “Photography against the Grain,” 15.
