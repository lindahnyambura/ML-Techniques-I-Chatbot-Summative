subject then sent a message to KaHinGa’s camp and KaMWaMba and WaraTHiTa came from KaHinGa’s camp with the news that KaHinGa had gone to nairobi with supol Henderson. The fact that he was not the leading figure in the surrender talks made subject angry and he returned to nyeri. on the 26th March, subject called for a Kenya Parliament meeting, but he got a letter from sTanley MaTHenGe, saying that his (s.M.s) group was going to deal with the Govt. direct without consulting the Kenya Parliament. subject states that he was very angry at this and ordered the arrest of MaTHenGe. MaTHenGe and about thirty others were arrested by people under the command of MaCHaria KiMenia and they were brought to the othaya Forest. KaHuiiTina was also arrested. on the night of the first of april 55, they escaped, and subject states that he has not seen stanley Mathenge since then, although he has had a letter from him asking for co-operation. subject then went to GiKonyu’s camp and returned to Tetu with MaCHaria KiMenia. He then went on a journey of no particular point to Fort Hall, Kiambu and the Kinangop leaving MaCHaria KiMenia there returning to nyeri early June 55. in his absence quite a lot had happened as KaHinGa WaCHanGa, Karari nyaMa, Kinaru GaTHunDi and GaTanGa GaCHiGWa had surrendered, MaKanyanGa had been killed and nDunGu KiMore, MaTHenGe WaCHiria and Gichuki Mugo had been captured. subject then went to nyaGa’s camp and on the 22nd June 1955 went to abDulla’s camp. on the 27th June, nyaGa was captured. VinDo went to Thomson’s Falls in July and was killed there. also in July nDeriTo THuiTa, subject’s most senior General next to MaCHaria and Mbaria, was killed in the nyeri settled area. in november 1955, MaCHaria KiMenia, nJuGuna Kirunyu and KabanGa GaTHaTWa were killed in rift and subject’s organisation fell apart. subject stayed with abdulla during this time, and little happened until March 1956, when the party was contacted by a pseudo gang, and abdulla was killed.
