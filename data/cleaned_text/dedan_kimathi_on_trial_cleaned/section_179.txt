on 21st october inspector blackman and asP Vidler carried out tests with a view to establishing that the pistol found on the accused was a “firearm” within the meaning of regulation 8a(4) of the emergency regulations and that the six rounds found therein were “ammunition” within that regulation. in my opinion the practical experience and training of both these officers qualifies them to speak as experts on Webley scott pistols and ammunition (Gatheru v Reg Criminal appeal 938 of 1954 eaCa) and the tests carried out by them established that the pistol in question was a “firearm”, and the six rounds found in it were “ammunition” within the definitions in emergency regulation 8a(4). in brief, the story of the accused is: Prior to his arrest on 21st october, 1956, he had been living in the forest for almost four years with his associates whom he calls “forest men” or Mau Mau. in February, 1954, he fell out with most of his associates because of a letter which he had written to Government advocating peace. They wanted to kill him and he moved away with five companions to a “hide-out” far away. He says that neither since February, 1954, (nor, indeed, previously) has he carried out any anti-british or anti-Government activity. The accused admits that he had in his possession on the 21st october, 1956, the revolver and ammunition which are the Judgment i 143 subjects respectively of Counts 1 and 2. He says that these were given to him in or about February, 1954, by one Macharia Kimanya for the purpose of defending himself against Mau Mau terrorists who wished to kill him. since February, 1954, the accused has been in the forest with five companions only. some others used to come and see him. The accused says that he knew about the surrender leaflets issued by the Government. There were, in fact, two lots of surrender leaflets, the first lot issued in august, 1955 {sic - 1953}, the second lot issued in January, 1955. The second lot was withdrawn in July, 1955.
