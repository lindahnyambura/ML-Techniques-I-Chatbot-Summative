and then walk to the gallows without trial.”76 Henderson reported that China wanted “no discord between him- self and Dedan Kimathi although he does not consider that Kimathi is a good leader.” While China claimed Kimathi had lost “a lot of prestige” and that he was “frightened to leave the forest,” he affirmed that Kimathi was the undisputed leader and could not “be deposed.”77 although China was found guilty and sentenced to death, his sentence would be commuted in return for his cooperation with the colonial government in negotiat- ing surrender terms with other Mau Mau generals still at large. after a large-scale surrender scheme negotiated by China and Henderson ended 14 i Julie MacArthur in what seems to have been an unintended slaughter by british forces of Mau Mau forces gathering to surrender, negotiations ceased and China was sent to lokitaung Prison until 1962, where he was imprisoned along- side future president Jomo Kenyatta.78 subsequent attempts at negotiations caused great internal dissension. Who should represent Mau Mau grievances and what the conditions of surrender should be caused ever-greater rifts to emerge among the leader- ship. in January 1955 the colonial government made another attempt at ne- gotiations, declaring a two-week cease-fire and dropping leaflets offering amnesty to Mau Mau who surrendered. according to Kahinga Wachanga, Kimathi rejected this offer out of hand, but Wachanga and others felt the offer was genuine and proceeded with the negotiations. What happened next is perhaps best told by Wachanga himself: at first light the following morning, we were awakened by Kimathi’s itungati. We were told to raise our hands and we were searched for weapons. Then we were marched to meet Kimathi and ten Murang’a junior leaders. That morning, Kimathi had his men arrest twenty- seven senior leaders. Kimathi interrogated us upon our arrival in his mbuci . He asked us why we had met with the government without him.
