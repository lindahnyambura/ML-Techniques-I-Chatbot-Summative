The epilepsy mitiga- tion defense had precedent in the Kenyan supreme Court, of which an advocate of Miller’s local experience must certainly have been aware. in the case of a murdered colonial officer, Grant, from 1946, the advocate defending the accused, Karamba ole sentue, claimed that an epileptic fit had temporarily affected his mind, causing him to thrust his spear through Grant’s chest. Two brothers of the accused were brought as witnesses to testify to ole sentue’s history of epileptic fits. While the court accepted that ole sentue suffered from epilepsy, it did not lessen his sentence when con- victed of murder.46 in another case, more than thirty years earlier (1913), an epilepsy-suffering european settler, Cornelius Grobler, murdered his wife and then tried to take his own life. in court, it was claimed that an epileptic fit had temporarily deranged Grobler and that this was the cause of his violent, aberrant behavior. Though the court treated Grobler with some sympathy, the plea of epilepsy as mitigation it did not prevent his conviction, on this occasion by a european jury.47 other than pleas relating to the mental health of accused, no similar defense on the grounds of the personal circumstances of any Mau Mau Mau Mau on Trial i 247 defendant is to be found in the cases brought before the special emer- gency assize Courts after July 1953. Moreover, Miller called three wit- nesses to give testimony on the question of Kimathi’s epilepsy. The first was a government physician, Dr. Turner, who was asked about the general effects of the condition. Kimathi’s mother, and a friend from his school days, then gave testimony as to the depth and extent of Kimathi’s past epi- lepsy. The mother, Wachiuri, had been brought to the court from a prison camp, where she was held under a government detention order. Though we have no documentation on this, her presence in court would have re- quired careful negotiation with the government.
