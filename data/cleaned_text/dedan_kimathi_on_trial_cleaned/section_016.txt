Introduction The Trial of Dedan Kimathi Julie MacArthur on 19 november 1956, Mau Mau rebel field marshal Dedan Kimathi stood or, more accurately, sat in front of Her Majesty’s supreme Court of Kenya at nyeri and asserted a “plea of not guilty.” after eight days of trial, Chief Justice Kenneth Kennedy o’Connor found Kimathi guilty of un- lawful possession of a firearm and ammunition and sentenced him to be “hanged by the neck until he is dead.”1 early on the morning of 18 Febru- ary 1957, Dedan Kimathi was hanged to death and buried in an unmarked grave in the grounds of Kamiti prison. This book centers on the trial of Dedan Kimathi—a piece of the co- lonial archive long thought lost, hidden, or destroyed. Dedan Kimathi re- mains a powerful symbol of resistance in Kenyan history. His dreadlocked visage, captured while he sat in the defendant’s chair on trial for his life, can be seen on T-shirts, in graffiti art on the sides of nairobi buildings, and on the sides of matatu (minibuses) throughout contemporary Kenya and farther afield. His name has often been considered synonymous with the anticolonial rebellion that engulfed colonial Kenya in the 1950s.
