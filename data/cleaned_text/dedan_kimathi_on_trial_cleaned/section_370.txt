in effect, Kimathi’s coming into being as a radical would not make sense outside a common narrative of african disenchantment across a set of vectors— with the Christian mission, the colonial school, and the role of the father— shared by his generation. To speculate further, the Kimathi who would emerge out of these nar- ratives would fall neatly into the structure and tropes that have come to define african life writing in Kenya since the 1940s. We can assume that Kimathi, like other members of his generation, tries his hand at petty trade or takes up casual jobs. We know that he eventually makes his way to ol Kalou, where he works as a clerk on a dairy or pig farm. and predict- ably, we know that Kimathi becomes radicalized when he comes face to face with other Gikuyu, embu, and Meru subalterns, commonly known as squatters, in the so-called settled areas. becoming a squatter is an im- portant transition, the beginning of the road to radicalization.21 and if squatters now appear to be the classical subalterns in colonial society, it is because of their uneven relationship to both the Gikuyu reserve and the White Highlands. They are a new kind of landless people, neither the traditional Gikuyu ahoi (tenants at will) under the protection of a land- owning class nor people with the right to settlement in the White High- lands. but if squatters appear to be totally displaced, they are connected to the political economy of colonialism more than to the ordinary peasants in the reserve, and, driven by what Tabitha Kanogo has described as an “expansionist dynamic,” they are eager to remake themselves outside the reserve and to reimagine themselves as new types of subjects—black set- tlers as it were.22 The Imaginary without an Image if Kimathi’s life is not extraordinary, why does he stand out as the great symbol of the anticolonial revolt in Kenya? and why does he attract the 322 i Simon Gikandi interest of creative writers?
