Having considered the cases of Mwangi s/o Wambugu v Reg  XXi eaCa {east african Court of appeal} 246; and Wong Poohyin v Public Prosecutor  3 aer 31 (PC), i directed the assessors, and i direct myself, that if the story of the accused is true and he was intending to bring in the pistol and the ammunition in order to surrender them to the proper authorities in response to an invitation in a Government leaflet and had done overt acts in pursuance of that intention, that could, in law, constitute a lawful excuse which would entitle him to be acquitted. i also directed the assessors (and i direct myself) that it would not afford a lawful excuse for one terrorist to carry a pistol and ammunition for the purpose of protecting himself from other terrorists whom he might have offended. briefly, the case for the Prosecution is that on the evening of saturday october 20th, 1956, a party of about 24 Tribal Police and Tribal Police reserve under a Tribal Police Corporal Wanjohi went out from Kahigaini Home Guard Post to line part of the continuous trench which divides the Kikuyu reserve (hereinafter called “The reserve”) from the forest in the south Tetu location of nyeri.
