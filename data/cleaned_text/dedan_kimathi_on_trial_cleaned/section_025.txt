First among them, a header at the top of the file read rePubliC oF Kenya—but there was no “republic of Kenya” in 1956.40 indeed in 1956 independence still seemed to many to be a far way off. The paper and typescript also did not match those in use at the time. The file had to have been produced in the postcolonial era. The file was also riddled with typos, omissions, and inconsistencies. at best, it seemed, this copy of the trial was a poor tran- scription of the original; at worst, it was a fabrication. in consultation with the staff at the supreme Court and archivists and scholars across east africa, north america, and the uK, i attempted to authenticate the file and see if a certified original could be located. During that time, even the copy i had been given access to in 2008 seemed to have gone missing again. exhaustive searches by archivists, curators, and staff at the supreme Court and elsewhere seemed to be yielding little. in 2015, i decided to widen my search. on a trip to the uK, i followed the trail left by the british lawyers who drafted Kimathi’s final appeal to the Privy Council. Many interested parties and parliamentarians in britain followed the case, warning of the danger of executing such a mythic figure in the Mau Mau movement and publicly pushing for the appeal.41 british Introduction: The Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 7 lawyer Dingle Foot took up the appeal. Foot had earlier successfully de- fended the Koinange family from the gallows.42 it can be assumed that a certified copy of the trial would have been sent to Foot to allow him to craft the appeal, though whether he would have kept a copy in his personal archives was a gamble. Foot’s archives, housed at Churchill College at the university of Cambridge, turned out to be under a hundred-year closure, meaning none of his files from the 1950s would be accessible until at least 2050.
