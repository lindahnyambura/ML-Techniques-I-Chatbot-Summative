Kimathiâ€™s ambition was to animate the collective cultural fantasy and dreams of violent revenge of subordinate but long-suffering africans who, however, never gave their personal hidden transcripts expression, even among close friends and peers.42 at the level of analytical understanding, this is what should matter to us most. it matters little, then, the idiosyn- crasies attendant to the pursuit of his stand or whether that stand was an act of outrage or rebellion, or an existential gesture.43 equally, important as they are to our full understanding of the man, it matters little what ascrip- tions or variable representations and multiple interpretations his image attracted contemporaneously or thereafter. next, at the level of social organization, Kimathi was able to impli- cate other important players, some of whom he knew through face-to-face relations.44 Put differently, he was able to draw upon resources of social organization greater than, or beyond, himself, such as ecologies of local community networks, and, by extension, the forged alliance of ethnic kin- ship and enlarged moral imagination of the Gikuyu.45 This level can be said to have been reached when Kimathi took to the nyandarua forest, where he rose to become one of the most important leaders of the Mau Mau re- bellion.
