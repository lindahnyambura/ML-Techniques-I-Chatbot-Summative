between guerrilla- martyr Kimathi, champion of the fighting Mau Mau and enemy of loyal- ism, and living statesman  Kenyatta, representative of the Gikuyu elders and the constitutional politicians and apostle of peace, reconciliation, and  forgive and forget.”10 Clough pointed to the “irony” of elevating Kimathi as a national hero, with many of his con- temporaries questioning his revolutionary credentials and pointing to his loss of support due to his notoriously strict disciplinary ethos and his leg- endary antagonism with the more populist General stanley Mathenge.11 Kahinga Wachanga, an early follower but later rival for leadership in the forest, described Kimathi as a great leader who fell from grace, turning jealous and power hungry in his later years.12 Wachanga was quick to re- mind his public that Mau Mau was not one man but a movement: “we had no one leader or commander except the oath. The oath was our leader.”13 in memoirs and popular Kenyan literature, Kimathi could be a tragic folk hero, a misunderstood rebel commander, a power-hungry despot, a pro- phetic patriot, a reminder of the lost dreams of revolution, or a dangerous precedent for future dissidents against the postcolonial order.14 as many of the contributions in this volume make clear, Kimathi embodied all these ascriptions. Kimathi came to symbolize many of the contradictions that Mau Mau, and indeed Kenyan anticolonialism and nationalism writ large, represented: rebel statesman, educated peasant, modern traditionalist. Whether Mau Mau was indeed a purely antico- lonial struggle or an internal civil war, a nationalist movement or a Gi- kuyu political project, a hastener or a hindrance to the achievement of independence in Kenya remain hotly contested debates.15 The position of “loyalists,” those who were perceived to work with the colonial state and proved successful in the postcolonial era, has engendered similarly bitter disputes.
