in addition, Kimathi’s execution was a stark enactment of colonial power intended to reinforce an imperial order and impose the authority of the colonial state.28 and this enactment of power over Kimathi as a colonial subject meant even more: this feared and hated “terrorist” was dismembered from memory, what he stood for now choked off, and the dangerous ideas and memories that he carried, buried.29 The man that colonialists wanted Kenya to forget became a byword for contempt and derision spoken only in hushed whispers. Kimathi, his image now besmirched, like that of many others whose lives were shame- fully ended on the gallows and his memory all but wiped from the public eye, for at least half a century, was an ambiguous historical figure unlike The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 291 self-styled but celebrated fathers of the nation. even after independence, a street named after him was only a token honor. but the significant military role he had played in the fight for freedom stubbornly remained a part of the national metanarrative and subject of the school curriculum. For most people, he remained an unspoken hero. but, as simon Gikandi points out in this volume, there was a gradually spreading ripple of public acclaim emanating from Karunaini, Kimathi’s birthplace, which naturally became the epicenter of the sustained memo- rialization of the man and what he stood for, despite years of neglect in the Kenyatta and Moi years. in the immediate neighborhood of Karunaini, numerous elementary and secondary schools are named after him.
