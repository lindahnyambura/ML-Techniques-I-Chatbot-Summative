entire communities are forever condemned as traitors to the cause, with no nuanced attempt made to explain the challenges of survival in a time of war. The Development of the Nyeri Museum and Other Initiatives Kariuki Thuku, the late son of war veteran Paul Thuku njembui (quoted earlier), first took me to see the abandoned old african Courthouse at ruring’u, near nyeri town, in 2008. not far away is the stadium where dreadlocked fighters famously laid down their arms, before Kenyatta and Kimathi’s widow, Mukami, in December 1963. built by the british in 1924, the courthouse was used for customary-law trials by and of africans, and meetings of local native Councils. Despite being half ruined, Kariuki thought it would make a great museum—in part because he and his fa- ther were convinced Kimathi had been tried there, which of course he was not.103 it appears he persuaded some nMK staff and others of this notion, 356 i Lotte Hughes too; if true, it would have added immensely to the building’s appeal today as a potential Mau Mau heritage tourism site. Though a key figure in the peace museums movement, and founder in 1997 of the above-mentioned agikuyu Peace Museum, Kariuki also had a passion for Mau Mau heritage and was trying to persuade the nMK to restore it and other war-related sites, such as the remains of emergency villages and caves used by fighters, one of which he took me to.104 He was ignored; the nMK’s then direc- tor of sites and monuments, Dr. Kibunjia Mzalendo, currently its director general, considered him a thorough nuisance.105 i would not be surprised, however, if the nMK did not lift certain ideas from Kariuki. it later ga- zetted the building as ruring’u old african Courthouse, restored it, and decided to turn it into a museum; it is the first nMK museum to be estab- lished in the former Central Province.
