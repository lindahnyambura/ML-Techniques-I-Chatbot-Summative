by choosing self-defense as his lawful excuse—his only possible means to secure an acquittal and escape the gallows—Kimathi had also chosen to put Mau Mau’s internal debates publicly on trial. For four days he had heard the prosecution evidence given by mem- bers of the Gikuyu Tribal Police (TPs). They claimed to have shot and cap- tured him as a fugitive terrorist. as dawn was breaking on 20 october, so they said, they had caught him returning to the forest that had been the 258 Mau Mau realm for the past four years. He was carrying maize and sugar- cane stolen from Gikuyu households at the forest’s edge. The TPs had chal- lenged him, he had fled and, after a few misses, one of them, ndirangu, had shot him in the groin, so preventing his escape. on the TPs’ evidence, then, Kimathi had come out of the forest because he was hungry; he had said nothing about wanting to surrender, or about his gun.2 Kimathi told a different story when he came to be examined by Kenya’s solicitor general, Diarmaid Conroy, an irish Catholic. He rested his defense on two grounds. First, he had lawful excuse for being armed in his fear of being killed, not by the colonial security forces but by the “forest men” from whom he had “finally split” more than two years earlier. This admission may not have surprised the court. Whites wanted to believe him to be a deranged psychopath, the supreme embodiment of the horror in which they held Mau Mau as a whole. equally, many of his own men were known to hate him as a dictator, however much they stood in his awe; his bodyguards strangled critics.3 Kimathi himself held that his would-be killers resented not his discipline but his strategy, his proposed peace talks with the british.
