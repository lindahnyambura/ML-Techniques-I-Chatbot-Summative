young men’s 266 i John M. Lonsdale migrant labor and female enterprise in trade, school, and urban property reinforced many men’s sense of social decay; the seeming growth in sexual license and marital discord was all the more shameful when Christian re- vivalists publicly confessed their sins.39 Dedan Kimathi was born into this climate of intimate unease in nyeri District, northern Gikuyuland.40 orphaned by his father’s death and at risk of scorn by being circumcised not with his age-mates but in a dispen- sary, he attended a succession of schools, both scottish mission and inde- pendent, between spells of work in varied capacities. after this disrupted youth, probably no more frustrating than for many others, one can see why, in his first public role as vice-secretary of a Kau branch in the White Highlands, his agenda included an african “code of behaviour.”41 For what this might mean to a man with a rare ability to reflect on his social and political circumstances we have the memory of Charles Harris, who as a teenager in the 1940s knew Kimathi as his father’s farm dairy clerk. The lat- ter disappeared before the emergency, leaving papers that Harris thought sketched out “a new order.” Kimathi had listed over twenty requirements, including those commonly demanded by ethnic welfare associations all over east africa, namely, bans on prostitution, male and female, and on drinking bottled beer.42 The first Gikuyu-language novel, Marriage Procedures, by Kimathi’s near age-mate Gakaara wa Wanjau, epitomized these anxious times. its Christian heroine hanged herself over her father’s gateway, his riigi, the symbol of household autonomy, because her lover, returned from the war, could not afford her father’s extortionate bridewealth demands. an elder’s greed had cursed young hopes of adult responsibility.43 on all sides, then, there were calls to repair broken moral economies of social obligation, for reasons deeper than building a political fortress.
