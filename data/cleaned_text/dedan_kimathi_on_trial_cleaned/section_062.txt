The trench where Kimathi was captured is now a site of commemoration, ostensibly controlled by the Mau Mau Veterans associa- tion, who provide visitors with tours of the site: “THe DeDan KiMaTHi TrenCH: Measuring approximately 40 by 40 meters, this is the place that the late mau mau  field marshall Dedan Kimathi was shot and captured on the 20th of october 1956. The site is located adjacent to the Thengeraini stream and nyayo tea plantation in Karuna-ini sublocation, Muhoya loca- tion of Tetu Division, nyeri County. The late Field Marshall was sentenced to death and later hanged on 18th February 1957. This site was gazetted by the national Museums of Kenya on the 21st of February 2001. To date, it is still unclear where the remains of the field Marshall are. The local community usu- ally commemorates his hanging and his heroic deeds to save the country from colonialism on the 18th of February of every year.” nyeri Museum Facebook page.
