on the reserve side there is mainly low scrub and bush with some cultivation. on the Forest side, thick forest cover to the edge of the ditch in most place; but there is at least one place, which will be mentioned hereafter, where it does not. in the party commanded by Corporal Wanjohi was a section commanded by a Tribal Police reserve sergeant – sergeant Mwangi. He posted his men in twos along the trench on the reserve side and astride the murram road which runs up from Kahigaini Village and Home Guard Post to the aberdare mountains. Facing the forest, sergeant Mwangi and two men, and another post of two men, were on the right of the road: on the left (sW side) of the road were two Tribal Police reserve Constables ndirangu s/o Mau and njogi s/o ngati. The night passed without incident except for the shooting of a buffalo. When it started to get light on the morning of sunday october 21st, ndirangu and njogi moved along the reserve side of the trench to their left, very quietly and slowly. They were looking for tracks. When they got to the edge of a place where there had been cultivation, ndirangu saw a figure carrying something over his shoulder which ndirangu could not distinguish properly in the dim light: it looked like poles. ndirangu says that when he first saw the man, he was about 35 yards away (the witness later indicated an object further away) along the trench, climbing the bank of the trench on the forest side. ndirangu saw him moving slowly towards the forest. at this spot there was open ground for seven or eight yards from the edge of the trench and then thick kei-apple (thorn) trees in a kind of a fence which would provide an obstacle to passage. When the man had climbed the bank of the trench and had moved about three yards, in the direction of the forest, moving slowly, ndirangu shouted “Who goes there?” in english.
