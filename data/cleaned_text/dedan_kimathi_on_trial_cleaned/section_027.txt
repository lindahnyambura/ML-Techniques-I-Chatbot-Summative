archivists and curators at the supreme Court, due in large part to the tireless efforts of stanley Mutuma, were able to locate two file folders containing an array of material from the trial, including original, hand- written letters by Kimathi submitted as evidence by the prosecution and 8 i Julie MacArthur the X-ray of the contentious bullet wound he received during his capture. From this material, it seemed likely that the copy of the trial i had been given by the High Court was a poor transcription from the original, hand- written notes for the trial, written in an obscure shorthand that made full transcription almost impossible, probably hastily copied down sometime in the 1990s, judging by the paper and typescript. These newly uncovered files still did not contain a certified copy of the actual trial, and so it ap- peared the record of the trial found among Millner’s papers was the only complete copy of the trial left in existence. Copies of the trial have now been “repatriated” to Kenya.43 The retrieval and availability of this mate- rial, due in large part to the support, dedication, and cooperation of a wide range of scholars, archivists, and staff across the chief justice and deputy chief justice’s offices, as well as the direct and enthusiastic support of for- mer chief justice Willy Mutunga and former deputy chief justice Kalpana Hasmukhrai rawal, has made possible the publication of this volume and the opening of a new chapter in the study of the Mau Mau rebellion.
