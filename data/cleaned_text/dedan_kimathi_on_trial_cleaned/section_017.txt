He was the self-fashioned Field Marshal of the Mau Mau, a movement that had many names, many faces, and even more interpretations.2 The Mau Mau rebellion, which emerged predominantly among the Gikuyu, embu, and Meru populations of Central Kenya, was a radical response both to 1 colonial settler policies of land appropriation and squatter labor restric- tions on the one hand, and to the repressive local african governing ap- paratus in the reserves and the slow-moving constitutional nationalists of the anticolonial movement in Kenya on the other.3 Kimathi rose to prominence in the early 1950s out of relative obscu- rity, first as an administrator of the oaths of loyalty sworn by “Mau Mau” adherents and then as leader of the fighters who moved into the forests after the colonial declaration of a state of emergency in october 1952. His charisma, flair for oration, and ability to evade british forces became leg- endary. For the british, Kimathi was a fearsome adversary. special branch superintendent ian Henderson, the man in charge of the “hunt” for Dedan Kimathi, compared him to Hitler.4 in his memoir, The Hunt for Dedan Kimathi, Henderson pictured Kimathi as both a formidable intellect and a cowardly criminal. in 1953 the East African Standard compared him to Mussolini.5 For many in Kenya, however, Kimathi conjured other histori- cal comparisons. William r. ochieng’ argued Kimathi had been “elevated to the ranks of Mao, lenin and Guevera.”6 ali a. Mazrui placed Kimathi among the top candidates in Kenyan history to be anointed a national martyr, akin to other global anticolonial heroes the likes of Gandhi.7 While the emergency and counterinsurgency operations would officially last until 1960, the capture and execution of Kimathi, in 1956 and 1957 respectively, allowed the british to claim victory over Mau Mau and solidi- fied Kimathi’s position among the martyred leaders of a failed rebellion.
