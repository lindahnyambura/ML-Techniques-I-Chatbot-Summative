in the forest, Kimathi already had 340 i Lotte Hughes one eye on the future memorialization of freedom struggle, hence his “obsession” with record keeping and writing everything down.10 He was not alone in this, as Derek Peterson has described when discussing the efforts of Karari njama, general secretary of the Kenya land and Freedom army, to pursue what njama called “the pen battle  was as great as the rifle battle.” Peterson writes, quoting njama, “by memorializing Mau Mau’s struggles, record books and letters to parliamentarians allowed for- est fighters to hope that, indeed, they would ‘receive happiness equal to the misery’ they had suffered.” He goes on: “Forest fighters were terrified of being forgotten. . . . The question of memory was the central concern of the famous Mwathe meeting of august 1953, convened in the aberdare Forest to organize far-flung bands of forest fighters. Dedan Kimathi . . . lectured hundreds of attendees about accounting. each Mau Mau camp was to keep ten record books. . . . Kimathi wanted memorial halls constructed after independence to house the registers. Mau Mau’s bureaucracy was devoted to popular memory.”11 before turning to consideration of memory, its uses over time, and the nature of what is remembered, let us stay with the subject of forget- ting—or rather, notions about forgetting. some sections of the Kenyan media have long peddled a pernicious line on Mau Mau—the idea that it has been “forgotten.” This could not be further from the truth. What jour- nalists mean, influenced by obvious pressure from veterans and human rights groups in particular, is that demands by veterans and their families for greater recognition, land, and relief from poverty have (apart from the first) largely been ignored by successive postindependence governments.
