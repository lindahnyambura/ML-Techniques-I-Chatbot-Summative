ul- timately, instead of simply appreciating, literally, the black-and-white facts or demerits of the case against Kimathi, i seek, in the conclusion of this reflection and with the benefit of hindsight, to argue that what’s important is what was not on trial in this colonial judicial process. indeed, it is here that one must not only end but also, most naturally, start critically engaging ruminations of the main documents related to the trial of Kimathi. From the outset, one is struck by the rather dated and in-the-heat-of-the-moment nature of the imperial judicial process. The entire trial and its findings were very much the product of the chaotic, The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 287 emotionally charged, and racially volatile political situation of the emer- gency period. Put more appropriately, Kimathi’s conviction was by none other than a court of emergency assize constituted under the Kenyan emergency regulations of 1953. in retrospect, there was never going to be a fair hearing. Just like the accused in the rivonia trial in apartheid south africa, Kimathi’s guilt was never in doubt. Just as the accused in the infamous trial in south africa, who were unlikely to have been found innocent under the sabotage act, Kimathi was not coming out unscathed, and acquittal was completely inconceivable under the Kenyan emergency regulations.9 The trial resembled George orwell’s “shooting an elephant” predica- ment.10 in the politically charged environment surrounding it, the court had to satisfy public opinion eagerly following the trial in the colony, brit- ain, and around the world. in its final ruling, the court had to be seen to adhere to an unwritten transcript of the managing elite that generally confirmed ideas behind british rule and the claims colonial authorities made to legitimacy.
