Vernant’s argument is that the tragic subject, tragic consciousness, and the tragic vision, were created in fifth-century bCe athens as part of the search for “a new way for man to understand himself and take up his position in relation to the world, the gods, the other people, himself, and his own actions.”52 He then goes on to make the crucial point that when the creators of ancient tragedy turned to the past for theatrical materials, they were trying to recuperate, from the legends of the past, a truth that transcended “contemporary events and current political life”: by refusing to place itself on the level of contemporary events and current political life, it acquired in aristotle’s eyes not less but more value, more truth than history. To present current events on stage would amount to no more than recounting what was happening. Producing a tragedy was a completely different undertaking. it was not a matter of inventing imaginary characters or devising a plot that took one’s fancy. it meant using the names and destinies of uni- versally known figures regarded as models, to construct a scenario, an arrangement of selected scenes in such a way as to show how and why such-and-such a character, being what he was, was likely, or even bound to take such-and-such an action that would lead to such-and-such a result.53 332 i Simon Gikandi onstage, it is hoped that the tragic figure—now connected to the legendary and universal—can help audiences cope with the disappoint- ments of postcoloniality by distancing them from the authorized dis- course of decolonization. under this scheme, Watene’s Kimathi works well as a tragic figure because he distances the audience from the pain of the postcolonial present and provides consolation through lamen- tation. in contrast, ngũgĩ and Mũgo produce a Kimathi who is heroic but untragic.
