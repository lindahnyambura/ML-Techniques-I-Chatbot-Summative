We took positions along the ditch which divides forest from the reserve. i was with Maina. We arrived at positions as it was getting dark. nothing happened that night. next morning something happened – we saw D. KiMaTHi. The first thing was that i heard gunshots – first i heard two. Then i heard a third one. i heard three shots altogether. i began to go in the direction to investigate, with Maina. We did not meet anyone. We met nJoGi and nDiranGu. They were members of our ambush party (identifies nJoGi). We had conversation with them. as a result of that conversation we began to search for a person whom they had seen. i do not know that place, but the search was near the trench on the reserve side. We searched for about an hour. We found someone. nDiranGu s/o Mau first found him. He said “The person we have been seeking for is here”. We went and joined nDiranGu. He was standing where DeDan KiMaTHi was. DeDan KiMaTHi was lying – there was a castor oil tree and under the growth of that tree he was lying. exs. 2 He was wearing a leopard skin and leopard skin cap. Those are and 3. they (exs. 2 and 3).
