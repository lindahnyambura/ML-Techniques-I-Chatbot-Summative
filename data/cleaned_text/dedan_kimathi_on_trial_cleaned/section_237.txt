My first word is, let the Kenya Government not behave as childishly through Mr. lytellon {sic} and Mr. blundell106 who definitely are rueing the british reign. any Governmental official or a Member of whatever sort may not suggest an ever enmity or hopelessly think that there is an end of Mau Mau in east africa and chiefly africa as a whole. The war ministers you suggest to set up for Kenya will shortly be regarded as tower of babel and will cause another new emergency to break out. let us dress the paining part of the body and the patient will soon recover. Who is not Mau Mau and who is Mau Mau among black and white in Kenya today? How far wide has Mau Mau spread daily while the Government watches behind instead of ahead?
