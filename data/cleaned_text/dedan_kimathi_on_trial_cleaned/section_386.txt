in this context, Kimathi is tragic in the sense that he has made a choice that has led to the destruc- tion of “Kindred blood / blood of my blood.”60 in the second instance, 334 i Simon Gikandi however, Kimathi appears to repress his memories and overcome his per- sonal loss—and hence the tragic consciousness—on the way to becoming the figure of legend, the one who embodies a justice that “is created / through a revolutionary struggle.”61 in the end, it is significant that neither The Trial of Dedan Kimathi nor Watene’s Dedan Kimathi lets the hero die onstage. by making sure that Kimathi’s death does not take place in front of the audience ensures the survival of a legend and its mode of truth outside the narrative of history, very much like his missing body. in this case, then, instead of literary scholars insisting on the ideological differences between the two plays, it is perhaps more productive to read them as presenting two distinct responses to the crisis of the mid-1970s, a period that marks the end of the legitimacy of the Kenyatta government, a fact that is dramatized by another drama of the period—the assassination of J. M. Kariuki, in March 1975. For many writers and intellectuals, including ngũgĩ, Kariuki’s kill- ing generates some of the most powerful sentiments on the failure of decolonization and is perhaps one of the major motivations behind the writing of The Trial.62 and although Watene’s play is written a year before the Kariuki assassination, it, too, is a dramatic response to the signs of the times. My interest in this essay, then, is how the two plays, though different in ideology and form, exhume the figure of Kimathi as a medium for ad- dressing the urgent need to rethink the terms of decolonization. Watene addresses this need by turning Kimathi into a tragic figure, the conduit for national mourning; ngũgĩ and Mũgo reject the tragic form because it defeats the idealism inherent in the politics and poetics of decoloniza- tion.
