The Special Emergency Assize Courts With the declaration of a state of emergency in october 1952, Kenya’s colonial government was granted significant new powers in the making of legislation and in the administration of the colony. These powers were permitted under the authority of the 1939 emergency Powers order-in- Council, a piece of catchall british colonial legislation that could be ap- plied in any colony, giving the governor discretion to pass and apply new laws without the restriction of being under martial law and having to subordinate ordinary governance to military command. as David French pithily explains, this allowed colonial governments “to maintain the out- ward appearance of legality and simultaneously employ as much or as little coercion and violence as they chose.”10 in each colonial context the interaction with existing local legislation forged its own characteristic out- comes under such conditions, and in Kenya two distinctive features were dominant: first, emergency Powers had the effect of militarizing Kenya’s colonial administration; second, in design and imposition the new regula- tions fell prey to the stern influence of Kenya’s white-settler population, whose vociferous political campaigning drove Governor baring toward increasingly draconian emergency measures.11 The powers granted to the governor included the right to alter the types of cases that could be heard by different levels of court and to extend the range of offenses for which a capital sentence could be handed down by the courts. at the outset of the emergency magistrates’ courts had been granted powers to hear cases relating to Mau Mau oathing ceremonies, for which the penalty could be life imprisonment.
