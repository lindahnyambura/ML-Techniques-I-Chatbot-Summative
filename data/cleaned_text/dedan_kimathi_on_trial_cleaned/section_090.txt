This was the kind of material (7 for identification). We got poles and made a stretcher and carried the prisoner away. i see the prisoner here to-day (identifies accused). it was as a result of hearing shots that i went and met ndirangu. We heard 2 shots at first. a third had been fired before we arrived. There was an interval between the 1st and 2nd shots. We went to investigate after hearing the 2nd shot. We did not run at first. We ran part of the way. We ran faster after hearing the 3rd shot. When we heard the third shot we had gone more than half way to where ndirangu was. after we arrived and started searching we heard no more shots. From the time we arrived until the prisoner was carried away on a stretcher, i did not hear the prisoner say anything about surrendering. Cross-examined. We were posted half a mile from ndirangu. We were in the reserve, not in the forest. The road was between me and ndirangu. Facing the forest, i was on the right of the road. i was about 35 paces from the road (indicated). i have a watch. Q. What period of time separated the 2nd and 3rd shots? a. about 15 minutes. i did not see ndirangu when the 3rd shot was fired. When i first saw him njogi was near the trench. When ndirangu saw us, 62 i Document 1 he came to us and said something. When we first saw ndirangu he was in the trench. When he spoke to us, we went into the bush with Mwangi and njogi. i know where ndirangu was. i could see him. He was searching as we were searching. We searched for about 20 minutes. Q. Did you not tell the Court a few minutes ago that you searched for 7 minutes? a. no, i never said anything about 7 minutes. (note: Witness said about the same time as he had been in the witness box – which was 7 minutes). Dedan Kimathi did not appear to be suffering much from his wound. There was a little blood. He said, “i am Dedan Kimathi s/o Wachiuri”. He was not talkative. re-examined: i did not have my watch with me that morning.
