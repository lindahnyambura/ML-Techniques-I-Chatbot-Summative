To confuse matters, a separate nearby project spearheaded by veterans was by late 2012 being referred to as “the first Mau Mau museum in nyeri” in a television news report; this showed veterans laying a cornerstone and invoking memories of Kimathi.110 also, in 2013 representatives of the nyeri County Government talked in media reports of plans to establish a Mau Mau museum in the county, without specifying where; no progress Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 357 appears to have been made since.111 all this—particularly the refrains of veterans, which can be seen as chiming with the themes of subversive rap112—suggests that subaltern desire for concrete memorialization of both Kimathi and Mau Mau remains irrepressible but (outside nairobi) has yet to be given material form by either national or county-level heri- tage managers—which is particularly odd in the movement’s heartland of former Central Province. This may well be a victim of devolution, fallen in the chasm between draft national and county cultural-heritage legisla- tion.113 Moreover, the nMK has the professional know-how but lacks the cash; the county government has the funds but lacks the know-how.114 The two have recently agreed to collaborate in the “mapping and gazett- ing of Mau Mau historical sites” in nyeri County, which include preinde- pendence native courts.115 nMK has also gazetted a number of other Mau Mau-related sites, such as the trench where Kimathi was shot and captured,116 a fig tree in the aberdare used as a post office, and caves allegedly used by fighters, but to my knowledge it has not developed these as heritage sites; as mentioned, it faces a financial crisis and cannot afford to do so.
