The latter had stated, “it is the government which is guilty, not me,” adding, after being rebuked by Quartus de Wet, the presiding judge, who asked him to plead either guilty or not, “it is the government which is responsible for what is happening in this country.”26 in light of the foregoing, it is hereby posited that the oppressive colonial order resting, as it did, on the social and legal construction of illegality, was not on trial, which, in retrospect, casts a shadow of doubt on this case. in other words, it was a blatant miscarriage of justice. as if this was not enough, as british colonial authorities were wont to do, Kimathi, the embodiment of anticolonialism, and by extension, a fighter against all that was evil in the heady, violent 1950s, was ignomini- ously executed and buried in an unmarked grave, his remains forever lost. With this physical, psychic, and existential erasure, it must also have been hoped that his memory was evermore expunged from the face of the earth. He was not only to be humiliated and dehumanized but also to be forgot- ten. as ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o observes, this can be seen as part and parcel of, generally, a european, and, specifically, a british imperial, dismembering practice of power. as such, it was intended to pacify colonial subjects. Put differently, such physical, psychic, and existential erasure was a symbolic act and performance of power intended to produce docile african minds.27 after all, the commutation of capital punishment was an integral aspect of colonial networks of power and violence.
