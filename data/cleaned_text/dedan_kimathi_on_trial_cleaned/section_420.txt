(The new agreement with nyeri County Government could change matters.)117 There was also the very curious case of an attempt in 2009 by an nMK “honorary war- den” to gazette alleged Mau Mau caves and other heritage sites on the soysambu estate of lord and lady Delamere; this came to nothing, but it embarrassed the then director general when he learned of it and an- noyed the Delameres.118 a more recent initiative is nMK’s collaboration with scholars at Karatina university, nyeri County, to excavate trenches and other war-related sites, including a “Kimathi trench,” and to establish a “Mau Mau education centre.”119 Commemoration of the emergency period is hampered by an ab- sence of materiality—no battlefields to match those of south africa, heav- ily promoted in lucrative cultural tourism, or the street murals (largely) celebrating paramilitary heroes of the Troubles, which have become a huge heritage tourism draw in belfast, to give but two examples from other parts of the world.120 The Kenyan landscape simply does not feature much physical evidence of what happened. Trenches and the odd tree are a tame substitute, while mass graves and massacre sites are unlikely to ap- peal to either domestic or international tourists, besides those of a very “dark heritage” persuasion.121 in the absence of other materiality, veterans 358 i Lotte Hughes have themselves become the embodiment of Mau Mau material culture in their matching branded garments, some sporting gray dreadlocks and brandishing Jomo-esque fly whisks.
