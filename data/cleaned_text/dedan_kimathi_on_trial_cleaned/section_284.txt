but their pleas for the return of the land “stolen” by white settlers used images that were both biblical and specifically, ancestrally, Gikuyu. such tensions are to be expected. as another senior historian of Kenya, Tom spear, has put it, all human societies know many “levels of intimacy”: gender, age, ethnicity, class, caste, schooling, religion, and so on.17 even british officials at the time had to recognize this inconvenient truth. in order to explain why some Mau Mau’s Debates on Trial i 261 other Kenyans joined the supposedly all-Gikuyu Mau Mau, the colonial government put the blame not on its own failings but on Gikuyu cun- ning: on their “indoctrination,” “viral infection,” “contamination,” “con- tagion,” “canker,” and “underground machination.” but some officials broke ranks to report that workers from western Kenya, none of them Gikuyu, saw Mau Mau as “an african national movement.”18 Moral un- certainty was not peculiar to africans; the british knew strategic ambi- guities of their own. such moral and strategic changes of view and direction provide us with a useful frame for analyzing the history of colonial Kenya’s african politics—what we need in order to understand Kimathi’s defense. Mau Mau’s debates, Kimathi’s dangers, his lawful excuse, are an extreme ex- ample of political dilemmas repeatedly encountered, not a different story. in summary, in the seventy short years of british rule, african po- litical activity swung in social scale, between small and large; in political focus, between regional and national; and in method, legal and violent. The possibility of imagining ever wider “levels of intimacy” or political solidarity underlay this oscillation. at the start, in the 1890s, there could be no Kenyan resistance to conquest; the british had not yet imposed a “Kenya” on the land. ethnic solidarity was equally unknown; “tribal” con- sciousness had not yet been sharpened by alien rule, biblical literacy, or nationalism.
