Home Guards training for service used an effigy of Kimathi for target practice.82 For many british officials, most famously in the case of superintendent ian Henderson, capturing Kimathi became “an obses- sion.”83 intelligence reports told of Kimathi wearing the overcoat of the “late Mr. ruck,” an image that certainly would have added to his brutal and remorseless image in british minds.84 a reward of Ksh 10,000, or £500, was proffered in 1953 for information “leading to the arrest of a for- mer secretary of the Thompson’s  Falls branch of the Kau, Dedan Kimathi wa Waciuri, who is wanted in connection with the murder of chief nderi.”85 While british soldiers were not eligible for such rewards, british company commanders, with the knowledge of their commanding officers, made unofficial offers to their soldiers of Ksh 100 “to kill the Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi”—a matter that prompted great controversy during the Mclean Court of inquiry in 1953 that investigated disciplin- ary breaches and misconduct among british forces.86 in october 1954 the colonial government published thirty thousand flyers in Gikuyu asking, “Have you seen Dedan Kimathi lately?” hoping to enlist the public’s help and further restrict Kimathi’s ability to move throughout the region.87 Kimathi’s legend grew with every month he eluded the british forces.
