The hunt for Kimathi was prolonged and aided by the coalescence of these various forces. in June 1956, Henderson’s forces captured Kimathi’s brother Wambararia, who fed them false information that stalled the search for a time.92 Henderson, by his own account, ramped up the search after Wambararia’s capture, sending “a select group of the very best of our converted terrorists . . . over ninety hard-core Mau Mau” into the forest to search for Kimathi.93 although accounts vary, Kimathi’s “forest wife,” Wan- jiru, either deserted him or was told by him to “be caught by yourself!” to allow Kimathi a close escape sometime in mid-october 1956.94 When Wanjiru was captured, “she swore at her captors, spat at them, bit them and kicked at them as they bound her up.”95 Henderson’s account of her initial obstinacy after her capture, sudden turn against Kimathi during interroga- tion, and surprising release soon after has led some to claim she gave cru- cial intelligence on Kimathi’s movements, though very little evidence exists to support these claims.96 in Henderson’s words, “it seemed that even ngai  was deserting Kimathi.”97 When Kimathi was finally captured, in the Introduction: The Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 17 early hours of 21 october 1956 in the emergency trenches dug to separate the “native reserve” and the nyandarua forest, he was alone.98 neither Henderson nor any of his “Mau Mau turncoats” were actually present when a troop of tribal police captured Kimathi on the edge of the forest reserve. While newspaper accounts and subsequent memoirs de- scribed the careful planning and the “tightening of the net” leading up to the capture, when read from the multiple accounts given as testimony dur- ing the trial the capture appears more accidental.
