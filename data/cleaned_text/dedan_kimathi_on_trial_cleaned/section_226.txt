at times, subject’s vicious temper became apparent under interrogation, and this, and this coupled with his domineering personality was obviously another factor, which led to his many quarrels with other gang leaders. sPHere oF inFluenCe subject stated that he considered he was at the height of his power around December 1953, when he had some 5000 people under his command. He stated that whichever area in the aberdares he was in at that time, he was accepted as a leader. He 188 i Document 5 admitted that he had no control whatsoever over Mt Kenya, as he had fallen out with Kaleba on the only occasion that they met, over gangs living in the reserves, and he had little influence in KiaMbu, although the KiaMbu gangs regarded him as senior leader and “prime minister”. His authority in rift was delegated to MaCHaria and Mbaria two of his most loyal Generals, although they seem to have ignored his frantic appeals for meetings later on in the emergency. GraDinG oF inTerroGaTion subject’s record of his life in the forest ties up very well with his diaries,64 and apart from his memory slips is comparatively accurate. He denies that he planned any actual raids, and makes no mention of some of his less endearing methods of keeping discipline in his own gang. subject flatly refused to incriminate anybody in the reserve who helped him in the very early days, and according to him behaved like an angel the whole time he was in the forest, never killing anybody. subject is a man of tremendous personality, with a well developed sense of humour, and punctuated his obvious lies with a large grin. The main body of the interrogation, his life in the forest, is graded b.2., but the rest is how Kimathi would like things to have happened, rather than how they did happen. a.D.
