branch sees the state’s decision to commission a statue of Kimathi, erected opposite the Hilton Hotel in the center of nairobi in February 2007, as very probably marking the official end of the search. in a discussion of the commissioning of the statue, Coombes points out that moves to erect a monument to Kimathi had first been made in 1971, when the nairobi city council considered rededicating the King George memorial to Kimathi; the plan was aborted.85 she links the gov- ernment’s decision to start planning the statue in 2006 to elections the following December, which were to trigger the greatest bloodletting of the postindependence period. she also notes how “Kimathi’s memory remained highly contentious throughout this period”; 2006 was marked by police crackdowns on members of the “Kimathi Movement.” she con- cludes that the statue “is susceptible to multiple symbolic stagings by 352 i Lotte Hughes competing constituencies,” which is both its strength and weakness, and that “it clearly lends itself to the reanimation of different versions of Kenya’s past while at the same time being the focus point for the demonstration of demands about its political future.”86 This symbolism became acute in June 2014, when a young unemployed man claiming to be Kimathi’s grandson, who said he shared the same name, chained himself to the statue in order to draw attention to the family’s enduring poverty.
