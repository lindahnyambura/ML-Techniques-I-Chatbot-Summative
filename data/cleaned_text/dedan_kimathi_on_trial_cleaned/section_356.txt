This recovery of the Kimathi transcripts comes at an interesting time in the recent analytical development of historiographical accounts, particularly Mau Mau history writing, which has, as exemplified by anderson’s Histories of the Hanged and elkins’s Britain’s Gulag, taken a sharp turn toward what Jean and John Comaroff have described as the “juridification of the past.” Comaroff and Comaroff, Theory from the South; Or, How Euro-America is Evolving toward Africa (boulder: Paradigm, 2012), 137).
