This terminology is taken from laragh larsen, “Power, Politics and Public Monuments in nairobi, Kenya,” Open Democracy, 8 april 2013, accessed 15 september 2016, https://www.opendemocracy.net/laragh-larsen/power -politics-and-public-monuments-in-nairobi-kenya. For her earlier work on the changing monumental landscape of nairobi, see larsen, “notions of na- tion in nairobi’s nyayo-era Monuments,” African Studies 70, no. 2 (2011): 264–83.

The “Wanjiku” peasant woman depicted in the Mau Mau Memo- rial may be seen as continuing that tradition, though she is secretly bringing food to starving forest fighters, rather than raising a flag amid public pomp and ceremony. 78.
