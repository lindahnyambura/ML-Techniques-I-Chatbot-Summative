For my own part, i must thank my colleagues in the africanist semi- nar at the university of Toronto. Presenting this work in its early stages to this highly accomplished group of africanists and having their support throughout the years were critical to the development and completion of this project. The university of Toronto, Mississauga, office of the Vice Principal, research and the Department of Historical studies both pro- vided funds that helped with travel, research, and publication costs. i also thank brian balsley for the wonderful maps produced for this volume. My sincere thanks also go to Gill berchowitz and the entire team at ohio university Press for all your patience, professionalism, and com- mitment to this project and to the field of african history more broadly. Two anonymous readers provided immensely detailed insights, points of critique, and words of encouragement that helped in the revisions to this volume. This volume is the product of collective labor. it belongs not to any one contributor but to all those who pick it up, read its pages, engage in its sometimes fierce debates, and imagine from its contents their own Kimathis.
