(ii) He had a little open ground and then a kei-apple fence ahead of him. That would have formed an obstruction. (iii) When challenged instead of turning round saying “Don’t shoot” waving a green branch or putting his hands up, he dropped what he was carrying and ran away down ditch away from ndirangu. (iv) When called upon to stop he failed to do so. ndirangu says that he pursued the man down the ditch with njogi following behind. The man tried again to get out on the forest side at a place where the bank had been broken down by Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 123 buffalo. The bank was there about 3 feet in height. ndirangu said “He failed to get out because i fired at him. He dashed back into the trench and continued running away from me. after he had gone down to the valley he climbed the other side and then climbed out of the trench on the reserve side”. apparently he was doubling round in a curve to get into the trench again. ndirangu fired a third shot and apparently hit him. He staggered and ndirangu lost sight of him. ndirangu and njogi went on. ndirangu left njogi at or near the place where they had last seen the fugitive and ndirangu went on to search. ndirangu went down to the valley to look for tracks. They blew whistles. others arrived – Mwangi s/o Kanguru and Maina. They searched for some time. ndirangu said about one hour. estimates of time by african witnesses usually very vague indeed. Then ndirangu says he saw someone wearing a leopard skin cap and jacket lying under a tree. These are the clothes (ex. 2 and 3). (read notes pages 7 to 8 “wanting to surrender”). it was put to ndirangu in cross-examination that Kimathi had drawn attention to himself by saying “i am Dedan Kimathi. i have come in to surrender. i have a pistol”. ndirangu said that that did not happen. it was put to ndirangu that he said: “you have given us enough trouble” and he fired his rifle at Kimathi who was squatting on his haunches on the ground and hit him in the thigh.
