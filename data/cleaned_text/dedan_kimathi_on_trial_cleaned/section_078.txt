(estimated very roughly at 70 paces . estimate afterwards corrected to 128 paces ). The accused was about 35 paces  (indicated) from me. i was about 2 paces from the nearest point to the ditch on the reserve side. Q. Does not thick forest come to the edge of the ditch? a. yes. Q. i put it to you that it would be impossible for you to see anyone to a distance of even 2 ft. from the edge of the ditch? a. at that place there was an open space. There was no bush between me and where i saw the accused. Q. How far were you from Dedan Kimathi when you fired the first shot? a. about from here to the road outside – further than the end of that hut. (Counsel agree distance to road is about 40 paces). before i fired i called out, “Who goes there?” i also said “stop!” i did not say anything else, except that i kept on saying “stop” in Kikuyu when i was running after him. i said, “Who goes there?” “stop” and nothing else before i first fired. When i fired the second shot, i was nearer him then when i fired first shot (indicates 37 – 38 paces). i chased him over a long distance before i fired the second shot. i did not really know how far as i was running after him. i think i ran about half a mile at a rough estimate (indicates from Court to valley). i then saw him climb out of the ditch on the reserve side. The distance between firing the 2nd and 3rd shots was longer than between the 1st and the 2nd – i ran further. i did not fire a fourth shot. Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 51 i am quite sure. i saw him roll over. When i fired the 3rd shot, i was down below and he was above me. i was on the side of a stream and he was on the other side above. He was about 40 or 50 paces  from me (indicated). When i first saw the man it was light. yes, it was “only nearly daylight”. after firing the 3rd shot, i saw the accused roll over and disappear. My companion was running close behind me. i had outrun him as he had an overcoat which prevented him. i could not say how far he was behind.
