on saturday 20/10/56 he was a member of a party of Tribal Police and Tribal Police reservists under Corporal Wanjohi. That 122 i Document 1 night ndirangu was in a party under sgt. Mwangi consisting of njogi, another Mwangi, Maina, njeru, (?) – 7 in all. They went to positions on the trench or ditch which separates the reserve from the forest near Kahigaini village, reaching the ditch about 6.45 p.m. while it was still light. sgt. Mwangi posted them in twos along the ditch. ndirangu was with njogi on the reserve side of the ditch near the murram road. ndirangu and njogi stayed there all night and saw nothing. When it started to get light, they moved left along the trench away from the road. They were looking for tracks. When they had gone a little distance, to the edge of the open space where there had been maize, they saw something. not correct that they saw something 35 yards from the road as Defending Counsel said. ndirangu says he saw a figure of a person carrying something over his shoulder. What it was ndirangu could not distinguish as there was not enough light to see it properly. ndirangu said it looked like poles. From what accused said you may think that it was sugar canes. When ndirangu saw the figure it – the man – was climbing the trench about 35 yards away from ndirangu. ndirangu was then on the edge of the ditch on the reserve side. The figure had climbed out of the trench and was moving towards the forest.
