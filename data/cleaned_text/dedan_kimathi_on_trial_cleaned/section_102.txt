Wanjohi. i saw him hand insp. sloan a pistol holster which sloan opened. He found a pistol in it. insp. sloan opened the pistol and took out 6 rounds of ammunition which he handed to me. i cannot tell what kind of ammunition this was, but it was short in size and had a blunt head. before the rounds were handed to me by insp. sloan i did not have any similar rounds. i have never possessed this kind. i only have .303 ammunition. i put the ammunition in my pocket in which there was nothing else but keys. i kept it there.
