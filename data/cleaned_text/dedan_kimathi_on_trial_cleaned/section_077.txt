it is also the opinion of my other two colleagues that there is no medical reason why the trial should not continue now subject to adjournment if his condition should deteriorate. no questions. Miller: He wishes to proceed subject to this, that symptoms may come on again. orDer. We will proceed; if he feels ill he is to let his counsel know and counsel is to make an application to the Court to adjourn. nDiranGu s/o Mau, on former affirmation: Cross-examined by Miller: i am a tribal policeman. on 21/10 i had on the same clothes as i have now (tribal police uniform and T.P. cap); also a blue overcoat. i made a statement to the police, insp. blackman, on 21/10 and i put my left thumb-print on it and it was translated to me and was true. Q. but you say, “about half an hour later as we were reaching the position we intended to stop at i saw something moving along the forest ditch”? a. yes, and that is true. Q. He was not then climbing out of the ditch when you first saw him? a. yes, he was. Q. you said in your statement: “i saw something moving along the forest ditch to my right: it looked to me as if it was a man, be- cause i could see that it was carrying something on its shoulder 50 i Document 1 which looked like sugar cane. i then shouted in english, ‘Who goes there’? and as i shouted this i saw the man, who was at this time climbing out of the ditch”? a. When i said, “Who goes there?” he had already climbed out. i saw this man who was at this time climbing out of the ditch going in the direction of the forest, drop back into the ditch, feet to me; i say i did not see him going along the forest ditch. The first time i saw him he was climbing up the ditch. He completed his climb out of the ditch. at that point the height of the ditch is not high. Having completed his climb, he went 3 yards (indicated) in the direction of the forest. When i saw him i was about as far from the road as from the Court to the sign- post at the cross-roads.
