in reality, his service was brief and confined to Kenya, a period even Kimathi omitted when relating his own biography to his interroga- tors after his capture.48 in 1942 he enrolled in the Church of scotland Mis- sion Primary school at Tumutumu but was expelled in February 1944, for reasons that remain a matter of debate. after trying his hand at a variety of jobs, ranging from dairy clerk to farm laborer and contractor, Kimathi returned to his old school of Karunaini as an “untrained” teacher. While his teaching career was short lived, Kimathi is widely remembered for his dedication to education. eloise Mukami, then a student at Karunaini and later married to Kimathi in 1948, remembered Kimathi as a brilliant and strict teacher: “Mwalimu Dedan Kĩmathi was tough. My schoolmates and i respected him for his intellect but also feared him for his insults when we did not perform well.”49 it is said that during his time at Karunaini Primary school he opened a night school, “teaching simple writing and reading to earn money to pay his school fees.”50 indeed, the tribal policeman njeru s/o Karundo, who would confirm Kimathi’s identity on the day of his cap- ture, in 1956, was a former Karunaini student and remembered Kimathi from his time there as a teacher. some time between 1947 and 1949, Kimathi joined the emerging na- tionalist movement, becoming a member of the Kenya african union (Kau), the first national political party in Kenya. Kimathi served as secre- tary for the ol Kalou branch, where Kimathi worked as a swineherd, and the Thomson’s Falls branch of the Kau, though the exact chronology of his time as secretary remains difficult to pin down. Kimathi’s political career and relationships within the Kau, however, seem to have been limited.
