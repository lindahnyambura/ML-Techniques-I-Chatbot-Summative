your Petitioner makes the following submissions in relation to the said summary dismissal of his appeal:- (1) That in view of the provisions of section 378 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 16 (1) of the eastern african Court of appeal order in Council, 1950 he was entitled, as a person who had been granted a Certificate of the trial judge under the said section 379, to have his appeal heard and determined by the Court of appeal and there was no power in a single judge to dismiss his appeal summarily under rule 4 of the eastern african Court of appeal (Kenya emergency assizes) rules, 1953. (2) alternatively, even if there is power in a single judge to dis- miss the appeal summarily in such a case, your Petitionerâ€™s appeal ought not to have been summarily dismissed under rule 4 (1) of the said rules in view of the fact that a certifi- cate for appeal had been granted by the trial Judge under section 378 of the Criminal Procedure Code. (3) That in any event on the evidence in this case and in view of the grounds of appeal put forward by your Petitioner his ap- peal could not properly or reasonably be dismissed summar- ily under rule 4 (1) of the said rules. your Petitioner therefore submits that his appeal ought not to have been dismissed summarily without a hearing by the Court of ap- peal. 14. THaT your Petitioner submits that by reason of the foregoing he has suffered a substantial and grave injustice.
