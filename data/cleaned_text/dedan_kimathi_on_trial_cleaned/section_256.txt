There was a requirement that assessors give a view on the case at the conclusion of the proceedings, however, following the summing up from the judge, but before the pronouncement of the judgment. Judges were formally in- structed to give weight to the views expressed by the assessors, but there is no substantive evidence from any surviving trial papers from the assizes that they ever did so. on the contrary, judges often expressed themselves as exasperated and mystified when assessors choose not to concur with the verdict handed down by the court, or to raise matters that seemed tangential to the key questions before the court. Given the risks of attack by Mau Mau, relatively few africans were willing to volunteer as assessors, and those appointed were invariably staunch loyalists, who were often 240 i David M. Anderson prominent members of Christian churches, active in the colonial adminis- tration, or involved in the Kikuyu Home Guard.25 The court proceedings were conducted in english and recorded in that language by a clerk, who produced a full transcript of each trial. Translation from and into Kikuyu or swahili was provided for any accused person who could neither speak nor understand english, but it is not clear from the surviving records how thorough or effective this procedure was. The transcripts of proceedings contain many sections where it is appar- ent that only an abbreviated version of a statement has been recorded, or where questions are omitted, so they do not properly constitute a verba- tim account. Many defendants were thought by the judges to be “disinter- ested” in the proceedings, and many comments from the bench indicate that the defendants may not have understood the nature of the charges against them, the character of the evidence, or the likely consequences of the court’s decisions.
