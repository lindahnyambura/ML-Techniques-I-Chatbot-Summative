Hip-hop artists and other male youth can be seen as a younger version of this phenomenon, in their branded Kimathi T-shirts, though many have cut off their dreads in order to avoid police harassment for being suspected members of the outlawed Mungiki sect.122 Maloba has previously described how both left and right in Kenya have used Mau Mau for their own ends.123 now left, right, and factions in be- tween (including veterans and their spokespeople) are attempting to use “memories” of the movement and conflict for a variety of new purposes. since devolution, some county governments are seizing opportunities to use Mau Mau to brand counties and (attempt to) develop struggle-related heri- tage tourism, taking advantage of the ongoing crisis in national heritage management and lack of clarity with regard to draft legislation. Following the postelection violence and international Criminal Court indictments that netted the current president and his deputy, it may be argued that the political elite promoted Mau Mau partly in order to deflect Kenyans’ attention from present-day abuses; it was used as a smokescreen. This con- stitutes Deckerinnerung, or the use of “one traumatic memory in order to cover up memories of another traumatic event that cannot be contem- plated directly.”124 This chapter has discussed other examples. a major problem is, and always was, the usability of Mau Mau mem- ory and history, and its relationship to nation and nationhood.
