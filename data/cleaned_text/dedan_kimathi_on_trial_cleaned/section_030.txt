in his interrogation, Kimathi asserted that he had seen then president Jomo Kenyatta at Kau meetings, particularly at the famous meeting at Thom- son’s Falls on 26 June 1952, but that he had “never had private conversations 10 i Julie MacArthur with him or with other political leaders.”51 The ol Kalou and Thomson’s Falls branches, where Kimathi served as secretary, were, by his time, con- trolled by the militant supporters of the Muhimu, an outgrowth of the anake a Forti (Forty Group) made up of ex-servicemen, urban gangs, and frustrated political activists of the late 1940s. rumors of a growing move- ment among the urban youths from the Muhimu, squatters, and a wider range of supporters in the rural areas of Central Kenya were spreading in the early 1950s. The Muhimu committee played a central role in transform- ing and spreading the practice of oathing from the urban areas to rural villages.52 Kimathi quickly rose among their ranks, becoming a respected oath administrator and organizer of a growing movement as yet without a name. Violent episodes increased into the early 1950s as attacks on settler farms, arson, and political murders gave shape to an emerging insurgency. reports of mass oathing ceremonies, growing resistance and acts of arson on settler farms in the White Highlands, and the murder of “loyalist” se- nior Chief Waruhiu prompted the colonial government to declare a state of emergency in october 1952. The following few months would see the murders of white settlers, senior Chief nderi Wang’ombe, and prominent nairobi politician Tom Mbotela.
