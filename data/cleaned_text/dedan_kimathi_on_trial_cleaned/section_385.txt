Thinking of the past, and the dear ones we left behind Can weaken our resolve. you are a leader of a revolution you must decide. but remember all the others Have left their wives, Their children, Their mothers, behind.57 This confrontation points to the larger question that ngũgĩ and Mũgo face as they struggle to represent Kimathi both as a historical figure and the embodiment of the future: How can Kimathi serve his symbolic role as the world historical individual, the character who provides “conscious- ness and great direction to a movement already present in society,” if he does not have the individuality that would enable the audience to empa- thize with his cause, his struggles, and his doubts?58 Can heroism without tragic consciousness speak to the demands of an age that lives under the shadow of an arrested decolonization and the pitfalls of national con- sciousness.59 in what appears to be an attempt to reconcile the mandate of history with the desire to imagine an alternative future, The Trial ends with a staging of two conflicting demands: in the first instance, Kimathi is seen as an individual whose weakness or fatal flaw is his attachment to memories of his childhood and his family.
