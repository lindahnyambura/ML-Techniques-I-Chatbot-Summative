on Monday 22/10 i went to the scene. i searched around near a castor oil tree which was pointed out to me by ndirangu and Wanyiri {Wanjiri}. i found near the tree two pieces of wh. cloth (7 for identity) which i identified at the time by writing on them. (Tendered. admitted ex. 7). Facing the castor oil tree from the trench they were about six feet from the castor oil bush. i should call it a bush. it had a number of branches growing up. it may have a central trunk but that doesn’t stand out. There are branches to the ground on the trench side. There was slight undergrowth – i should think growths from the root. you could see through the tree. at the bottom you could see through, but not easily. you could if you peered through. There were other trees in the vicinity but not similar to that. There was no tree there which would have offered a better hiding place. i have spoken to the accused and heard him speaking. He speaks very good english. He was charged by Mr. baker. subsequently i interviewed him to see if he could give more  security information in respect of other matters. He did not assist me at all. The accused has never on any occasion mentioned to me or to anyone in my presence the fact that he wished to surrender. He has made no complaint to me or to anyone so far as i know that when he was coming in to surrender he was shot. Cross-eXaMinaTion: The depth of the valley from the castor oil tree to the bottom of the valley was 200' to 300'. Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 77 The valley runs more or less parallel with the trench. The slope at Pt. G from the trench is fairly pronounced. as you stand at the castor oil tree and look at the trench, you would have to raise your eyes. When i said there was no tree there that would offer a better hiding place, that is a result of my recollection, but not by inspection. When i asked the accused for security information he did not refuse in so many words; he said that he had no information. His manner was obstinate.
