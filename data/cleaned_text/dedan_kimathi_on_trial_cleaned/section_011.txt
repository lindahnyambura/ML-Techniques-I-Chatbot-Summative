“We cannot stand on the fence. We are either on the side of the people, or on the side of imperialism . . . either fighting with the people, or aiding imperialism and the class enemies of the people.” if the publication of the colonial records, which are pitted against the interpretive narratives of leading scholars on Kenya, including Kenyan intellectuals such as simon Gikandi and nicholas Githuku, as well as other international researchers on Kenya, helps reignite the debate about Kĩmathi’s legacy to Kenya, africa, and the world, it will have served a great purpose. We thank and commend Julie Macarthur, her editors, and the publishers for making these important colonial records available for pub- lic scrutiny and for the very first time in history. Congratulations!

Finding the trial indeed proved difficult and perplexing. i have told the full story in the introduction to this volume and elsewhere.
