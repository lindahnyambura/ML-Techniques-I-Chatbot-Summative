i thought it possible that ndirangu’s third shot did not hit the accused, and that he was shot under the castor oil bush where he had taken cover: that ndirangu having searched and found him and heard who he was, and knowing that he might well be armed, shot him in the leg to make quite sure that he did not run away again; and that ndirangu and those of the other members of the party who might know of this were afraid to say so. ndirangu’s account of the wounding of the accused was not supported by njogi who first gave an account of how the man was shot in the trench and afterwards corrected this and said he had not clearly seen the accused when ndirangu fired the third shot. The exact circumstances in which the accused came to be wounded are not in themselves an issue in the case. They are important, but important only to the extent that they affect the credibility of the witnesses and the answers to the issues which i have set out above. i unhesitatingly accept the evidence of ndirangu as to the circumstances in which the accused was first encountered and the chase in the trench, except that i am not quite so sure that the accused was hit on the bank by the third shot as described. i also accept without hesitation the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses as to the finding of the pistol and ammunition on the accused, and all the other subsequent circumstances of the case. i did not consider the accused to be a witness of truth. i thought that, in view of the letters which he had written to Government 148 i Document 2 subsequently to February 1954, his statements that he had ceased his terrorist activities in February 1954, was untrue. i believed little of his evidence. in particular, i did not believe that he was coming in to surrender on the 20th/21st october. i find as facts that he was returning to the forest when challenged and that he made off as fast as he could and did his best to escape.
