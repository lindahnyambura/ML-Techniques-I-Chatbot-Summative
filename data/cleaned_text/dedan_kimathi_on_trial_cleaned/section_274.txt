“Perhaps we can now take it fairly for granted that Kimathi is a strong candidate for inclusion tomorrow in the book of Kenya Martyrs.”59 The documents on the trial of Dedan Kimathi add to our knowledge and understanding of the complex history that surrounds him, but more than half a century on he still stands as the iconic hero of Kenya’s rebellion against colonial rule, his statue adorning one of the main thoroughfares in Kenya’s capital, nai- robi. His heroism, as Mazrui understood it must be, is symbolic as well as historic. Notes 1. ngũgĩ and Mũgo, Trial. 2. Kinyatti, Kenya’s Freedom Struggle; Kinyatti, History of Resistance, 331–36. 3. Karimi’s Dedan Kimathi is the most thorough account of Kimathi’s life yet published, but Karimi acknowledges (p. 261) that he was unable to locate the trial papers. Kanogo discusses Kimathi’s capture but says nothing about the trial. Kanogo, Dedan Kimathi, 26–27. njeng’ere, Dedan Kimathi, a Kenyan secondary school textbook, recounts his hanging and burial in an unmarked grave at Kamiti Prison but, again, says nothing about the trial. Kahiga’s Dedan Kimathi, styled as a “documentary novel,” ends with Kimathi’s capture. Maina wa Kinyatti offers an essay on Kimathi’s supposed “revolutionary philosophy.” Kinyatti, Mau Mau: A Revolution Betrayed (new york: Mau Mau research Center, 1991), 79–93.
