The committal proceedings, ordinar- ily undertaken in Kenya before a magistrate, provided the opportunity to establish the basic facts of the case, to review the essential evidence that would be brought before the court, and so to determine the relevant charge. Despite the fundamental nature of this change, the chief legal ad- viser to the Colonial office, roberts-Wray, failed to fully understand the implications of the removal of the committal proceedings until four days after his office had approved the new regulations: “any accused person will be grossly hindered in his defence,” roberts-Wray now wrote, “if he comes to his trial knowing nothing of the evidence to be given against him.”18 When london pointed out this dangerous aspect of the new legislation, nairobi’s response was to permit the defense counsel to see witness state- ments for the prosecution in court, but in practice this came much too late to be of any real use. Court procedures also removed the requirement for the prosecution even to provide the defense counsel with the list of witnesses that were to be called in special emergency assize cases. This limitation was intended to protect witnesses from intimidation and was a direct response to the fact that Mau Mau supporters had been extraordi- narily successful in the early months of the emergency in interfering with witnesses. Defendants therefore had no idea who would appear against them in the dock until they arrived in court. While the prosecution as- sembled as many witnesses as they required, the court procedures and the lateness of notifications meant that the defense counsel usually found it practically impossible to call witnesses.
