some of these include the emphatic rehabilita- tion and reinstatement of the Mau Mau moment in Kenya’s national his- tory during the administration of its third president, Mwai Kibaki, which eventually culminated in the erection and official unveiling, in 2006 in the heart of nairobi, of a statue honoring the embodiment of the struggle for independence, Dedan Kimathi Waciuri. This followed the publication of two seminal works touching on the criminal nature of british counter- insurgency in the 1950s by Caroline elkins and David anderson; and the triumphal high-profile case against the british government by a group of Mau Mau veterans who won the legal suit in london in June 2013.1 but even more fascinating was the unveiling, on 12 september 2015, of a monument funded by the british government honoring Kenyans killed, tortured, and ill-treated by british forces during the Mau Mau war in the 1950s. This particular event was presided over by the british high com- missioner, Christian Turner. This particular project was part of the 2013 284 out-of-court settlement by the british government to pay £20 million ($30 million) in compensation to Mau Mau veterans.2 Quite predictably, new litigation against the british government, by more than forty thousand Kenyans alleging physical abuse or mistreatment during the insurgency against colonial rule in the 1950s, was lodged in January 2016.3 all these critical developments are testament to the unrelenting power of the past, its riveting grip on human agents who lived it, and the resiliency and gravity of memory as well as its hypnotic relevance in the present, and, therefore, its embedded capacity to not only spark imagi- nation of the possible but also to inspire both legal and political action. This lively demonstration of, and reflection on, how this particular past deeply affected specific individuals, families, and society at large and the development of the state is instructive.
