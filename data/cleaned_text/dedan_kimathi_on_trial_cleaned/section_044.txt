inside, on trial for his life be- fore a british judge and a jury of three Kikuyu elders from his native village, was her son, Dedan Kimathi, 36, self-styled Field Marshal, Knight Commander of the african empire, President of the Parlia- ment of Kenya and Commander in Chief of the land liberation army, the man once feared through all Kenya as the leader of some 10,000 Mau Mau terrorists.113 The article would go on to describe Kimathi as “riddled with venereal dis- ease . . . a leader with no army, betrayed even by his mistress . . . only the memory of past power to sustain him.” as an ambulance drove Kimathi away from the courthouse each day, the article contin- ued, “a crowd of impassive Kikuyu natives watched in stony silence,” and Kimathi’s mother “stared at her son’s Kikuyu judges and spat in the dust.” Present in this obviously sensationalized account lurk many of the colonial assumptions regarding not only Kimathi but moreover the wider african public who bore witness to this trial.114 inside the courthouse, Kimathi stood trial with his court-appointed lawyer, Frederick Miller, before Justice o’Connor, Crown prosecutor Con- roy, and three Gikuyu “assessors.” by all accounts, Kimathi appeared fee- ble, visibly drugged and in pain from the surgeries performed on his leg and hip after his capture. indeed, the proceedings had to be suspended on the first day due to concerns over Kimathi’s medical condition. This was not to be a soapbox trial, as in the cases of other anticolonial leaders put on trial the likes of Jomo Kenyatta and nelson Mandela.115 as litigant, Kimathi proved himself the ever-controlled, measured speaker he had gained a reputation for in debating clubs and in his command of troops in the forest.
