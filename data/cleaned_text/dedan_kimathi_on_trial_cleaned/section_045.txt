Kimathi used the complicated internal politics of Mau Mau, the colonial government’s often contradictory counterinsurgency strate- gies, and his own painful, seemingly hidden history of epilepsy to make his case.116 it was this last strategy that provided some of the most poignant mo- ments of the trial: in Kimathi’s words, “during my life i have suffered from what the Kikuyu call ‘devils.’ it throws me down to the ground and i be- come unconscious. . . . it started a very long time ago when i was young . . . when i was a small boy. i have these fits very often. They have continued all 20 i Julie MacArthur my life.” While epilepsy remains a highly stigmatized disorder in modern Kenya, its associations with excessive religiosity, mental instability, or pro- phetic calling have a distinct colonial history.117 Kimathi spoke of receiving treatment for his condition in the forest: “i have been treated by ‘medicine men’ (Witness corrects the interpreter’s translation to ‘Witch doctors’) not by african doctors of medicine.” Kimathi’s correction of the interpreter here raises questions not only about translation but moreover about the role of witchcraft in the movement: in 1955, the district officer and later historian John C. nottingham voiced the widely held official view that “on witchcraft all movements such as Mau Mau must be built.”118 indeed, both sides appealed to the power of witchcraft in their propaganda: british pro- paganda painted Mau Mau fighters and supporters as brainwashed, under the spell of powerful leaders who used witchcraft to control their loyalties, while Mau Mau propagandists similarly invoked their ability to harness witchcraft powers and enlisted Kamba witchcraft practitioners to “employ power and paraphernalia against the state.”119 such testimony also raised questions regarding Kimathi’s mental state, and indeed the collective mental stability of all those who fought in the forest.
