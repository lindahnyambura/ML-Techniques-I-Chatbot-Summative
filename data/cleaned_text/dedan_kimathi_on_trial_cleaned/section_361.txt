as Macarthur noted (via personal e-mail), one of the interesting things about the trial’s material discovery is how early talk of negotiation started, coupled, of course, with “surrender” and “amnesty.” i agree with her that it is also a thorny issue and double-edged sword yet so little studied. it is no wonder that David anderson’s contribution in this volume identifies it as a theme of the history of the Mau Mau rebellion that needs more intellectual scrutiny. in Mau Mau Crucible of War (200–208), i have cast this topic of “surrender and amnesty” within the broader important question (one that en- gaged and divided members of the legislative Council, especially europeans), of what defeating Mau Mau and returning to “normalcy” really meant. 65.
