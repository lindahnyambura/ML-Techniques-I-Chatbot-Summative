—Kĩmathi, character in the play The Trial of Dedan Kĩmathi it is in the light of this statement that we offer our observations on Julie Macarthur’s publication, a historically significant intervention and addi- tion to existing scholarship on Kĩmathi. Macarthur’s work is critical in three main ways. First, makes available to the public, for the very first time, the original transcript of the kangaroo trial of Dedan Kĩmathi and other related documents. second, it comes on the sixtieth anniversary of that notorious trial and the execution of Field Marshal Dedan Kĩmathi at Kamĩtĩ Prison, nairobi, in october 1956. Third, the book’s appearance during the decade of fiftieth jubilees for independence all over africa is a reminder that it was the Kĩmathi-led armed struggle, the first of its kind against european colonial powers on the continent, that broke the back of imperialism and so opened the way for the liberation that the various na- tions are now commemorating. The publication affords Kenya and the world yet another moment of serious reflection and stock taking in revisiting one of africa’s most com- pelling moments in the history of resistance against colonialist and impe- rialist injustice. The colonial script Macarthur makes available reminds us of an ancient african proverb that has many versions, but offers the same caution: “until the lion tells his story, the tale of the hunt will always xiii glorify the hunter.” in Kĩmathi’s case the lion never lived to tell his story, and the hunter was relentless in his attempts to define, within his own terms, the lion that died fighting back the colonial hunter. “i would rather die on my feet,” Kĩmathi once said, “than live on bended knees.” but this is not the spirit of the Kĩmathi that emerges in the colonial mega narrative contained in the court records.
