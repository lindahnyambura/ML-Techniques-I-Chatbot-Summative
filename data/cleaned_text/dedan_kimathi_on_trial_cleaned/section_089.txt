Mwangi. i was put in position with Mwangi s/o Kanguru on the edge of a trench separating the reserve from the forest. We stayed there all night. on the following morning we heard 3 shots. We went in Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 61 that direction to investigate. about half a mile on the way we met ndirangu. He was standing in the trench and he said something to us. We went into the bush on the reserve side. ndirangu then called out, “He’s here”. That was not a very long time after meeting ndirangu – about 7 minutes (indicated). We – Mwangi, njogi and self – went to ndirangu. ndirangu asked a man who was under a bush, “Who are you?” i could see the man. it was a castor oil tree and under it was some undergrowth. The man was lying down. He was dressed in leopard skins and buck skin. up to this time we had all been searching. (it was only ndirangu who called out). We were searching for a person who had disappeared in the bush. no, we did not call out to him. ndirangu asked the man who he was. He replied, “it is i, Dedan Kimathi”. He was asked to raise his arms and did so. He was then told to come out and he did so, but he said that he had been shot in the leg. He rolled himself out. i saw him searched by Mwangi. He found a pistol. ndirangu found a simi. Mwangi took the pistol, and he handed it to sjt. Mwangi. The prisoner’s wound was dressed by selah Gitahi. i used Cpl. Wanjohi’s shirt – he tore it and tied up the wound. i see this piece of material.
