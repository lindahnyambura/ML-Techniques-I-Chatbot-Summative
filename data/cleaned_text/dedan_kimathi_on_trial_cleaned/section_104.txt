i saw him place another round of .38 ammunition in the revolver and fire the shot from it at these two pieces of wood which had been placed together. The second shot hit the left hand piece and went through it, the bullet going through the piece of wood into the sandbag behind it. i marked the entry of this bullet with the figure “2” and wrote my name in pencil on this half of the wood. i retrieved the bullet from the sandbag and handed it to inspector blackman. This is the bullet (18 for identification). i then saw inspector blackman eject the spent cartridge case from the revolver and i noticed that it had three marks on it. This is it. (8a for identification). From my experience in firearms and the experiments i carried out i say this is a lethal barrelled weapon capable of discharging a bullet. Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 73 on the following day i went to a place where there is a trench separating the reserve from the forest. i went with inspector blackman, ndirangu Mau and Corporal Wanjohi. a spot was pointed out to me there by ndirangu Mau and Corporal Wanjohi. it was a castor oil bush about 30’ down a bank on the reserve side of the trench – 30’ from the edge of the trench. i look at exhibit 1 (plan) and point out where this is and mark it “G”. There were branches and leaves on the tree which would be about 5’ high. some of the branches were bending over towards the ground. it was fairly bushy. by the foot of the tree there was a little undergrowth – fairly long grass and that type of thing. some of the earth had fallen down the slope and made a small bank about 6” high against the trunk of the tree. you could see through the foliage of the tree. i searched the vicinity and found two pieces of cloth. These are they (ex.7 for identification). blackman took possession of them and marked them with his initials and the date. These were found about 6 ft. from the tree – n.e. of it. i mark it “H”. i looked for papers – documents. i didn’t find any.
