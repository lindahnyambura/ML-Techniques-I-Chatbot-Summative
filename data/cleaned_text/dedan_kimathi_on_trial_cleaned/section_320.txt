The trial itself, therefore, was part of a wider exer- cise of power in which the judge was expected to venerate the law and thus affirm claim to legality and imperial high-mindedness.11 Kimathi, the hotheaded elephant that had gone on rampage against the colonial order, had to be put down.12 after all, it is well known that the court is not an organism dissociated from the times in which it exists. Kimathi was tried in a court that did not deliver its opinions in a legal vacuum. Colonial judges and prosecutors were not abstract oracles but rather men whose views were necessarily, though by no conscious intent, affected by inheri- tance, education, and environment, and by the impact of history, of the british imperial past, and of the Mau Mau moment that unfolded before their eyes.13 it follows that one of the most prominent implications of the release of these archival materials to the public will be a bitter castigation of the british colonial brand of justice unfairly meted out against Kimathi. This expected reaction is not simply emotional or simply a demonstration of anticolonial patriotism or nationalism. rather it is an issue that strikes at the crucial intersection between law, morality, and natural law. extended scrutiny of the sticky relationship between law and morality lies outside the purview of this reflection. legal and moral norms vary from place to place and, most crucially in this case, from one historical period to another. indeed, this is a persistent theme in 288 i Nicholas Kariuki Githuku the philosophy of law: the search for unchanging norms that are univer- sally valid.14 underneath the thin veneer of consensus on legal principles, there is often a struggle of interest going on.
