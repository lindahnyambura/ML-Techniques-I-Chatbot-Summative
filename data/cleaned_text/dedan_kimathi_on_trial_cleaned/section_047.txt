in his memoir, former spe- cial branch officer Derek Peter Franklin provided an account of Kimathi’s final days, relayed to him by his brother raymond, who served as one of Kimathi’s guards. He described Kimathi’s cell as cramped and stench ridden, with Kimathi originally manacled by one hand to the wall above his bed before medical concerns prompted an adjustment of the spatial arrangement in his cell.124 another account offered a different image of Kimathi in his final days. on a torn slip of paper telegraphed to london in February 1957, a “senior Prison officer” at Kamiti Prison described Kimathi as a model prisoner, and said of his final walk to the gallows, “to the last he was composed and quiet.”125 Kimathi’s death prompted a variety of responses. in the Daily Worker, renowned author Doris lessing called Kimathi’s execution “a completely barbarous act of which we should all be deeply ashamed.”126 solly sachs, a prominent trade unionist exiled from south africa, predicted “the execution of Dedan Kimathi will send a wave of horror and indignation throughout the peoples of africa and asia, and of europe and america, who are bitterly opposed to the policy of terror and oppression in Kenya and other parts of africa.”127 For many Kenyans, mourning for Kimathi would have to remain clandestine with emergency regulations still in ef- fect until 1960, thousands still in detention, and no body to bury. The date of his death, however, inspired yearly commemorations and has served as a symbolic reference point for continuing postcolonial struggles.128 The Volume This critical edition provides the first public availability of the complete trial of Dedan Kimathi.
