Transparency and the right of access to xi information are hallmarks of our new constitution. access to our histori- cal records must be part of this commitment. The supreme Court of Kenya is dedicated to honoring this history. in 2015 we opened a museum in the former prison cells located in the basement of the court to allow fellow Kenyans and international visitors to experience the history of transfor- mations within the judicial system in Kenya. This volume makes a vital contribution toward this goal. This volume will, for the first time, make public and widely available the record of the trial of Dedan Kimathi, a piece of our history long thought lost. The trial, which would end in Kimathi being sentenced to death by hanging, repre- sents an important turning point in the history of struggle in Kenya and thus provides a window into the hopes and unfulfilled visions of Kimathi’s time. The scholarly reflections brought together in this volume reveal the deep historical significance of figures like Kimathi, the moral lessons we can learn from the past, and the continuing relevance of the struggle for independence in Kenya today. We, as Kenyans, must reckon with our past. We must honor our free- dom fighters—not just Kimathi but also the many women and men from across this country who have fought for justice and freedom. i salute the Kenyan contributors to this brilliant volume for their pa- triotism. i salute and glorify the great global solidarity and commitment to our struggles reflected by our international comrades who are also contributors. a luta continua, a vitória é certa!
