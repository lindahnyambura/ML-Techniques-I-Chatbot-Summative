While encouraging caution regarding the possibility of the “colonial fabrications” that Mũgo and ngũgĩ point to in their foreword, anderson demonstrates just how crucial such texts can be in the historical project of “triangulation” and the “balancing of evidence.” There is perhaps no scholar more renowned or respected for inves- tigating the moral economy of Mau Mau than John lonsdale. in his con- tribution, lonsdale draws together threads of arguments he has made throughout his career to examine the ways Kimathi’s defense put “Mau Mau’s internal debates publicly on trial.” setting Kimathi’s defense in a lon- ger genealogy of moral disputes over social obligation, collective action, and generational discipline, lonsdale investigates the “intimate unease” and necessary subversions such histories engendered. Placing the Kimathi trial into a broader social and political context, nicholas Githuku’s chapter offers provocative insights and critical reflec- tions on the roles of legality, morality, and identity within the Mau Mau movement and the decolonization of Kenya. Githuku importantly asks readers to think equally about what was “not on trial” in Kimathi’s case. using a broad theoretical and interdisciplinary framework, Githuku un- packs the “uneasy tango” of britain and Kenya’s colonial pasts and reveals Kimathi as a “privileged identity” in contemporary conceptions of nation- alism, state building, and social justice. 24 i Julie MacArthur simon Gikandi’s chapter delves into the spaces between literary repre- sentation and historical imagination, memory and forgetting, materiality and absence, the archival and the imaginative. as popular literature has played a prominent role in the making of “Mau Maus of the mind,” Gikandi explores the elusive literary figure of Kimathi as a “floating signifier”—a symbolic referent for national imaginaries that resists repression despite the danger his figure continues to pose to the postcolonial state.
