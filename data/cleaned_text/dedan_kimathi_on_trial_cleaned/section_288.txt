in 1930, with this modern ethnic patriotism at his back and britain’s democratic history before him, Kenyatta called on the colonial office to promote “by constitutional means the interests of the Gikuyu Community and their rights and liberties as citizens of the brit- ish empire.”29 like Kimathi years later, his representative role was soon undermined by argument behind his back.

To the discomfort of its secretary, Kenyatta, away in london, and possibly against his instincts, the Kikuyu Central association (KCa) angrily defended the custom as the guarantee of social order.30 but some athomi now thought it barbarous; missionaries would not otherwise have dared such a radical bodily reform. Had Gikuyu opinion not been divided there would have been no crisis.31 each side had a different history in mind.32 KCa’s conservatives relied, implicitly, on a patchwork dynastic past in which Gikuyu lineages had la- bored separately to civilize the land, a constant test. Christian subversives called on a parallel, pan-Gikuyu history of recursive change. every thirty years or so in the past eligible sons had bought out their fathers’ juridical powers in order to heal the land of their accumulated envy.
