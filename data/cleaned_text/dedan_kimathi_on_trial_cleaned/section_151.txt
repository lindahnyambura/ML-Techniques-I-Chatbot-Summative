He does not say he had lawful authority: e.g. a license. He does say he had a lawful excuse. The burden of proof of that is upon him. DeGree oF ProoF. The accused in proving lawful excuse has not to reach such a high degree of proof as is required of the prosecution: he need not satisfy you “beyond reasonable doubt”. it is sufficient for him to show that it is more probable than not that he had a lawful excuse. i direct you as a matter of law that if the accused’s story is true and he was intending to bring this pistol and ammunition in in order to surrender them to the proper authorities and he had done overt acts in pursuance of that intention, that could in law be a lawful Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 119 excuse which would entitle him to be acquitted. He has to prove that it was more probable than not that that was so. That is the main issue in the case. i also direct you as a matter of law that it would not afford a reasonable excuse for one terrorist to carry a pistol and ammunition for the purpose of protecting himself from other terrorists whom he might have offended. i may here mention that there is no defence of insanity in this case. The epilepsy about which the accused has called evidence is not in itself a defence to either of the charges. in order for it to be a defence he would have to go to the length of saying that through disease affecting his mind he was on the 21/10/56 either incapable of knowing that he possessed a revolver and ammunition or incapable (through disease of the mind) of knowing that he ought not to possess them. He does not say either of those things and his doctor specifically says that his epilepsy would not have had either of those effects. Therefore there is no defence of insanity.
