but even more crucial is the implica- tion of this recovery to many questioning readers, analysts, the general public, and even to british-Kenya relations. This chapter is a reflection on the relevance of these files to questions of anticolonialism, loyalism, decolonization, and the (re)construction of postcolonial nationalism and statehood. To this end, my reflections revolve around the following broad ques- tions: what has, until now, been Kimathi’s place in people’s memory and how have people chosen to remember him (especially former fighters, then foes and contemporary admirers)? Where does he stand as a symbol of nationalism and as a rallying political object in the postcolonial process and project of nation and state building? Has or does the aura and political symbolism that has grown around Kimathi’s militant image of defiance still continue to inspire political dissent in the postcolony? What are the implications of the discovery of the transcripts of Kimathi’s trial and court appeals with regard to all the preceding questions. in other words, how will it affect how Kimathi is remembered? How will it affect Kimathi’s political symbolism? Finally, how will it impact his militant image? Will it serve to fortify and solidify his selfless heroism for having paid the ultimate price and, hence, further his political symbolism that could, once again, rekindle the dwindling spirit of nationalism badly needed for national integration and state building? Will it confirm his unfailing mettle, even at the most trying moment of his trial, with the gallows hanging over his head?
