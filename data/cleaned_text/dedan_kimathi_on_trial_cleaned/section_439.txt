For a discussion of Kariuki’s creation of the agikuyu Community Peace Museum and later career, see Hughes, “sacred spaces.” The cave he took me to was part of the Kariba Mau Mau Caves on the ruui ruiru river, ngaine location, Mathira West District, July 2006. Kariuki also shared with me a well-researched proposal for creating a replica emergency village—“Forgotten relic: a Kenyan emergency era Village” (no date, but likely to have been 2007/8). He constantly lobbied nMK and may well have shared this idea with them, too. He wrote in the proposal: “Why does Kenya need a replica of a co- lonial emergency era village now? The 1953–1961 colonial villages shall remain a strong historical heritage of our collective memory and history that we can- not afford to lose. . . . so much of our Mau Mau memories resides  in the experiences lived out inside .” He saw their potential in what he called “democracy-based tourism.” 105. Hughes, “sacred spaces,” 132n45. 106. i have spoken on several occasions to veterans at this site, including 27 august 2009. nicholas Githuku, contributor to this volume, also spoke to veterans there when assisting me with research for the project Managing Heritage, building Peace. 107. The chairs and some other exhibits can be seen on the nyeri Museum Facebook page. The plaque was originally on a street in the middle of nyeri town, where it was vandalized. it was brought into the courthouse partly for safekeeping. My thanks to Julie Macarthur for information. The museum’s collection may have changed since she visited. 108. i was previously told by nMK staff that it was to be called the Mau Mau Museum. but nMK contacts now say this was never the case and that its official name is ruring’u old african Court; this is contradicted by its “nyeri Museum” Facebook page.
