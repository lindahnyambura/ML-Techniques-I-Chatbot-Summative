earlier mausolea were built to honor fel- low Kapenguria six members Jomo Kenyatta, Paul ngei, bildad Kaggia, and achieng’ oneko, as well as Tom Mboya.

Paul Thuku njembui, interview by lotte Hughes, World social Forum, nairobi, 25 January 2007. Then aged about eighty, he spoke some en- glish, picked up during his seven years in detention camps. This was the first of many interviews and conversations with Thuku, mostly when i stayed at Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 365 his home, in Kinayu village, Karima Forest, othaya District. He had earlier been a key informant of Derek Peterson’s. Thuku died in 2014. He claimed to have sheltered Dedan Kimathi in his home in 1952. by saying “Kenyatta was there,” Thuku implies that the british sought his advice about what to do with Kimathi, which is obviously a mythical construct. Thuku headed the board of the agikuyu Community Peace Museum, nyeri, established by his late son Kariuki. see lotte Hughes, “sacred spaces, Political Places: The struggle for a sacred Forest,” in Coombes, Hughes, and Karega-Munene, Managing Heri- tage. unlike the lari Memorial Peace Museum, the board then consisted solely of ex–Mau Mau. since Kariuki and his father died the museum has been taken over by Kariuki’s widow, lydia, who has distanced herself from other Kenyan peace museums; it is not clear if it still has a board. 51. an illustration of how confused some Kenyans still are about the re- lationship (if any) between Kimathi and Kenyatta, is this request, in response to a picture story about the unveiling of Kimathi’s statue and war veterans mingling with young fans of Mau Mau, by “njuguna,” asking for the photos “plus any vedio  of dedan kemathi  with mzee jomo” posted online 19 november 2003.
