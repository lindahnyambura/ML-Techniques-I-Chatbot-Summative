in The Trial of Dedan Kimathi, by ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o and Mĩcere Gĩthae Mũgo, and produced at the Kenya national Theatre in 1976, we see a belated at- tempt to give Kimathi an affirmative character so that he can intervene in the politics of the present, move audiences beyond officially sanctioned amnesia, and perhaps chaperone social discontent toward revolutionary ends. The Trial sets out to undo Watene’s ideology as it is represented in his dramaturgy, and to provide a systematic critique of the Kenyan state’s version of history, especially what appears to be its willingness to privilege the interests of the pro-colonial forces over those of nationalism. The key to understanding the ngũgĩ/Mũgo project, then, is to see how their de- construction of Watene’s dramaturgy goes hand in hand with their ideo- logical critique of the Kenyan state. ngũgĩ and Mũgo bemoan Watene’s 328 i Simon Gikandi neocolonial project without mentioning his name; they cannot, however, escape its shadows. interesting points and counterpoints emerge here: if Watene’s goal is to turn Kimathi into the tragic tope—the figure of suffering, betrayal, and lamentation—ngũgĩ and Mũgo seek to detour the economy of suffer- ing and mourning and instead dramatize the trial of the real, but elusive, Kimathi. if Watene’s anxieties are dramaturgical, driven by the need to fit Kimathi into the idiom of Greek and shakespearean tragedy, ngũgĩ and Mũgo’s anxieties are primarily historiographic; they want to use the dra- matic stage as an extraterritorial space in which Kimathi, now freed from the colonial imaginary, can function as a symbol of the masses in “the only historically correct perspective.”40 Taking Kimathi’s heroism for granted, ngũgĩ and Mũgo do not seek to turn history into theater, but theatricality into history.41 it is hence significant that in The Trial, Kimathi’s story is told in move- ments rather than acts and scenes.
