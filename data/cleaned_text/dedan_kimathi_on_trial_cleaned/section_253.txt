The burden of the evidence sought from these prosecution witnesses was descriptive and factual—establishing the identities of the protagonists and circumstances of the arrest, describing the nature and cause of any wounds, and dealing with simple matters of the date and time of events. evidence provided by prosecution witnesses would be challenged by the defense in an effort to expose any discrepancies or contradictions between witnesses, or to reveal any uncertainties or ambiguities. over time, there was a clear move on the part of the Crown to call fewer prosecution witnesses, thus lessening the opportunities for the defense to unpick the case. by the time of Kimathi’s trial, at the end of 1956, in cases with a single accused it was rare for the prosecution to call more than half a dozen witnesses.21 The majority of the defense lawyers appearing in the special emer- gency assize Courts did so under what were termed Paupers’ briefs. al- located by the office of the attorney general, this system allowed the state to impose a defense counsel to ensure that an accused person was prop- erly represented in court, and it lessened the possibility that Mau Mau accused, if allowed to defend themselves, might seek to politicize trials. 238 i David M. Anderson However, Whyatt quickly found that Kenya’s european lawyers were gen- erally reluctant to take on emergency assize cases, declining the Paupers’ briefs when they were offered. Though this was considered improper be- havior—members of the bar were expected to take such briefs as an act of professional citizenship—Whyatt was reluctant to air the issue in public and so instead steered the briefs toward Kenya’s many asian lawyers. They were prepared to take these briefs despite the low fee rate, while some, such as Fitz de souza, ajeet singh, and a. r. Kapila, also did so out of a political conviction that such cases should be defended on principle.
