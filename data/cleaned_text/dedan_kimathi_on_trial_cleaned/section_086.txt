When ndirangu fired the third shot you did not see him? a. no. From some time after the second shot i did not see him, till i saw him under the castor oil tree. Q. Why did you tell the court that he was 138 yards away in the trench? a. if i made a mistake in that, i also made a mistake in saying that he was in the trench. When he was shot a third time, he was on the side of the trench. so ndirangu told me. He said “The man has crossed into the reserve. stay here and i will search.” i was mistaken in saying that the man was in the trench when he was shot. in fact, i did not see him shot. ndirangu was in front of me when he shot. ndirangu told me to wait there while he went ahead to cut him off. after a little time two other men came. Q. Did you wait there until you were called to the castor oil tree? 58 i Document 1 a. no. by that time four of us had gone into the bush to search. i remained on the top of the bank for about 20 minutes to en- able ndirangu to reach the place that he was going. i did not hear a shot fired then or at any time after i left the trench. From the time i left the trench to when i saw him under the castor oil tree was – i can’t say how long. i had no watch. Maybe about half an hour. From the top of the trench where i was to you 20 yards (indicated). Where ndirangu called me to the castor oil tree, ndirangu was 2 or 3 yards from where the man was under the castor oil tree. He was about 10 yards or 12 yards from me when i called him. We did not search for blood. Q. if ndirangu told you the man was wounded, would it not have been reasonable to search for bloodstains? a. We did not think of that. We thought he might run away. ndi- rangu went about 40 ft. ahead (indicated). We searched for him for about half an hour. yes, i am liable to forget. i think i had only forgotten about him being in the trench. i do not think i have made any other misunderstanding. The third shot hit him. Q. How do you know? a.
