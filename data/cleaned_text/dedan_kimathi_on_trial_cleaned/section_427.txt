Close examination of photographs of the lari “massacre” held in file Tna:Pro, Co 1066/1, which i have obtained copies of, suggests a different story. Questions arising include: why would british government propagandists circulate grisly images of people killed and mutilated by their own side? Why are many of the bodies burnt (which by all accounts they were not in the second massacre), mutilated by pangas (machetes) (ditto), with no visible bullet wounds (guns were not used in the first massacre), and with village or homestead structures clearly visible in the background, when the second massacre reportedly largely took place in nearby forests? 27. Photographs of victims of the first lari massacre, and one of suspects shot in the second, were published, for example, in Mau Mau: A Pictorial Record (nairobi: The english Press, 1953). The single image of victims of the second massacre shows a neat lineup of male bodies laid on their backs, cap- tioned “The Day after lari . . . Mau Mau who met the 23rd” (a reference to the 23rd King’s african rifles). its careful composition seems to deliberately sug- gest a “cleaner” orderliness of state-orchestrated killing with guns, as opposed to the “mess” left by Mau Mau pangas, but this second massacre was anything but clean or orderly. 28. anderson, Histories of the Hanged, 177; osborne, “rooting out,” 82. 29. ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, Petals of Blood (london: Heinemann, 1977, 1986 ed. cited), 100. 30. ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, Dreams in a Time of War: A Childhood Memoir (london: Harvill secker, 2010), 281–84. 31. The TJrC’s public hearings across Kenya between 2009 and 2011 cov- ered a wide range of historical abuses. The TJrC’s mandate ran from inde- pendence, in December 1963, to February 2008, hence earlier abuses related to Mau Mau could not be considered.
