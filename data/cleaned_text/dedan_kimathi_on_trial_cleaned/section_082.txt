i saw something which looked like a stump of a tree. He came up to a place where there was some maize plants near the trench on the reserve side. The thing that looked like a stump was on the forest side of the trench. The stump was near the trench – on the side of it on top of the side of the trench about two paces from the top of the trench. at that time it appeared to be still. it was not easy to see – not light enough. i looked at the stump closely. it moved when ndirangu shouted “Who goes there?” it went along the trench away from us – in the direction away from the road which crosses the trench and comes to the aberdare Mountains. He was running. He was carrying something which i did not distinguish – something placed on the shoulder (indicates horizontal position on right shoulder). it looked like trees (poles). When ndirangu shouted, “Who goes there?” he dropped it. ndirangu shouted “stop” in Kikuyu, many times. Then ndirangu began to run after the running man and i began to run after him. We ran along the trench after the man who was running towards Thengeraini along the trench. still in the trench running after this man we saw him try to climb the bank of the trench towards the forest. i fired one shot into the air. We were still running in the trench; we noticed that the man tried to come across and ndirangu fired another shot. ndirangu was in front. i fired in the air so as not to shoot ndirangu. The bank was on the forest side where the man tried to climb out. The bank was about 3 ft. and had been broken down by buffaloes. When i heard the shot the man came back into the trench and began to run in the same direction until ndirangu fired a third shot. ndirangu fired 3 shots. i fired 2 shots. ndirangu fired the 2nd shot when the man was trying to climb out on the forest side. That was when i fired my shot into the air. When ndirangu fired his 3rd shot, the man was about 38 paces  away from him (indicated). The man was still in the trench.
