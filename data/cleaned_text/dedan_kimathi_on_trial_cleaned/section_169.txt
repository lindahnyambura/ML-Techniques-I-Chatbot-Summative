The doctor thinks he is a reasonably intelligent man, intelligent above the standard of a man of his education. The doctor makes no suggestion that he is insane, he knows what he is doing and he knows the difference between right and wrong. He found no sign of mental deterioration in the accused which is a common gradual result of epilepsy. Dr. Turner said: “inasmuch as anaesthesia and operations are well-known precipitating causes of a fit, it can be said that an epileptic may have a fit brought on by an anaesthetic and an operation. if he did have one under the anaesthetic it would not be noticed and that might cause a headache and subsequent mental blurring up to 48 hours afterwards”. This evidence is brought for the purpose of showing that the accused may have been mentally blurred when he was charged by the police the day after he was captured and said nothing then about having come in to surrender. you must take that possibility into consideration and the possibility that the doctor who examined him – Dr. Hurley – that a.m. with the specific idea of ascertaining whether he was fit to answer questions and who gave it as his opinion that the mental condition of the accused was then clear and normal, may have been wrong. oTHer WiTnesses To ePilePsy. you have heard the evidence of accused’s mother and Joseph Wakaba to the effect that the accused has suffered from epilepsy from a child. as to the epilepsy therefore you should consider whether, assuming that he is an epileptic, you think that the fact that in answer to the charge he did not specifically mention the fact of having had the pistol and ammunition because he was coming in to surrender, was due to: (a) forgetfulness, headache, giddiness and mental blurring brought on by a possible epileptic fit while under the anaesthetic the day before, or (b) because 134 i Document 1 it was not true that he was surrendering and he had not then thought of that story. For you to consider. ConClusion.
