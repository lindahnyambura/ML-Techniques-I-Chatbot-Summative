General China),34 Kimathi had immense intelligence value, so the state was keen to treat his wounds and ensure that he could be properly and thoroughly interrogated. Kimathi was therefore spared the “roughing up” at the hands of Home Guard and police that was so often the fate of other captured Mau Mau forest fighters. There was no accusation to be made here of beatings or abuse of the prisoner—in contrast to the mus- ings of Kinyatti in his unreferenced and misleading account of Kimathi’s treatment35—although the conditions to be endured in the basic concrete- block structure that was the nyeri jail were far from comfortable. The record of Kimathi’s interrogation suggests that he was far more guarded than had been the talkative and sometimes boastful itote, but he nonetheless provided his interrogator with a detailed account of the structure and organization of the forest gangs, much of this proffered in demonstration of Kimathi’s claim to overall command of the Mau Mau movement.36 This interrogation report directly contradicts many of the statements that Kimathi would make from the dock during his trial— claims that he had been disaffected from the Mau Mau movement since February 1954, that he had been attacked by other members of the move- ment, and that he moved about the forest in fear of his life from further assaults—and hence needed to carry a weapon. However, although the prosecuting counsel challenged these points, the court was not presented Mau Mau on Trial i 243 with the evidence of the interrogation report. Though it might be argued that withholding Kimathi’s interrogation report served a specific political purpose for the british, it was in fact normal practice not to present such reports in the courtroom.
