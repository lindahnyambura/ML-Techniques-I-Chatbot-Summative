any ordinary special emergency assize trial would most likely have seen the appointment of a lawyer working on a Paupers’ brief, perhaps one of the able and energetic Kenyan asian lawyers who so often filled this role: but the government decided they could not leave Kimathi’s defense to chance, and keen to be seen to be doing everything possible to facili- tate the smooth process of the case, the state paid to secure the services of a leading and highly respected nairobi european advocate, Frederick Henry Miller. it is not clear that Kimathi had any say in this appointment, or even whether he was fully aware that he had a choice in accepting or rejecting the advocate proposed by the court, but it is certainly apparent that Miller was properly remunerated for the task and given every oppor- tunity to consult with his client in an effort to build a credible defense.43 Miller arrived in nyeri several days before the hearing, giving him plenty of time to speak with Kimathi, and from the character of the trial it seems that Kimathi did indeed cooperate with the advocate, putting forward a defense that differed markedly from the initial statement he had made to police officers on 22 october 1956. all this, again, was far from normal in special emergency assize hearings. Kimathi’s initial statement became a bone of contention during the trial, as the accused sought to modify, correct, and sometimes refute the information contained in the transcript of the interview. in their preface to this volume, Mῖcere Gῖthae Mũgo and ngũgῖ wa Thiong’o suggest that Kimathi’s statement may have been a “colonial fabrication.” Pointing to its formulaic structure, laying out a well-ordered sequence of “facts,” and its many incriminating admissions, they describe the statement as resem- bling a “polished report crafted from carefully researched information.”44 in one sense, this is surely correct.
