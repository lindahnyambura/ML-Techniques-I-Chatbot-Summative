as drama- tists, ngũgĩ and Mũgo will seek to undo the colonial image of Kimathi by carefully deploying the technology of the international avant-garde, more specifically the brechtian epic theater, as a mode of undoing the ossified fact of history.46 onstage, colonial history will be subjected to radical acts of difference and différance.47 a good example of this play of difference/ différance is the incorporation of ian Henderson into The Trial as hunter, judge, and presumed executioner. For audiences familiar with Hender- son and his role in the arrest and trial of Kimathi, his reappearance as the corporate, allegorical figure of colonialism past is has to be read as a para- doxical gesture of undoing colonial discourse. renamed shaw Henderson in the play, the discredited colonial agent comes to function as the ghost of the colonial past and the postcolonial present.48 since ngũgĩ and Mũgo are keen to rescue Kimathi from the prison house of colonial discourse—including what they considered to be the farcical trial in nyeri—they need a dramaturgy that can rescue the na- tionalist hero from space, as much as time. in this respect, one of the most innovative devices in The Trial is the breakup of the unity of time and place associated with classical tragedy. The primary setting of the play is the courtroom in nyeri, where Kimathi is tried, but this space doubles as a street, a camp in the forest, or even as a numinous historical space in which the drama of nationalism is played out. The dispersal of space enables Kimathi to escape the constricted prison house of colonial governmentality and the force of the law. in a sense, the Kimathi we see onstage always transcends spaces of confinement. Kimathi’s transcenden- talism enables him to function as a hero but not a tragic one.
