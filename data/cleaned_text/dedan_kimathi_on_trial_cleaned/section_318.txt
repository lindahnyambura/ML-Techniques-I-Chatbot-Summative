This chapter presents Kimathi as a resistant subject who, in such a rare moment—in the con- text of the 1950s conflict—emerged as a “privileged identity” posited as a historical subject.7 Put differently, a political actor who, through various identity-shaping disciplines and technologies of the self, achieved a pos- ited identity that overcame individual isolation or inertia; an individual who understood power relations and how they affected his existence and that of others; one who was propelled by this knowledge to pursue possi- bilities of what he could be in the process of which he was also able to or- ganize others against colonial authorities; and, lastly, one who attempted, with relative success, to tap into the rich loam of african dissent and real grievances.8 in spite of evidence showing that he was a man like any other, vulner- able, suffering personal weakness, and even, perhaps, having moments of self-doubt, in light of his celebration in the erection of the Kimathi statue and that of Mau Mau at uhuru Park; in light of his constant disinterment in popular culture; in light of the “legal illegality” of colonialism, and therefore, the trial itself, and the burning embers of anticolonialism that are still alight; in light of the victorious litigation between 2009 and June 2013 by three Mau Mau veterans, and the newly lodged suit; and in light of the natural inclination and people’s constant need for heroes, and the reliance by nations on national myths for nation- and state-building pur- poses, Kimathi’s place in people’s memory, and Kenya’s history, remains intact. and, further, and following from the historical context of the “il- legality” of colonialism, that the whole judicial process was a mistrial.
