space precludes a longer discussion, but in memory terms i have ar- gued elsewhere that the outpouring of narratives triggered by the legal case (not those of the plaintiffs, but personal stories unrelated to the ac- tual case, published and broadcast primarily in the local media), their re- petitive nature and mass circulation, are serving to skew public, media, and even some scholarly discourses about Mau Mau.88 The interplay be- tween repetition and recollection is a problematic one, as Patrick Hutton pointed out long ago, prompting the question: has the repetition of (unnu- anced) trauma narratives in this context led to the construction of “false” memories or, at the very least, rather unreliable ones?89 The case could Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 353 be described as one of the “social cues” that has triggered the production of collective “remembering” in this group context—the realm of veterans’ groups and their supporters.90 some narratives have not been produced by victims at all, but by spokespersons. Writing on the global proliferation of victimhood as a construct, Didier Fassin and richard rechtman note how “the voice that is generally heard is  not that of the victims, but that of their self-appointed spokespeople.”91 one no longer has to have been a direct witness to suffering, or to have experienced it, in order to be a victim. using the media to fan the politics of recognition, different groups are competing for attention, employing a hierarchy of trauma in which their historical pain is portrayed as worse than that of others, and therefore more deserving of recompense—or simply a larger slice of the postinde- pendence cake. explicitly or implicitly, there is a localized “blame” thread running through many of these narratives (blame of Kenyans, especially “loyalists,” rather than the british; also blame by one veterans’ group of other veterans’ groups), which is likely to make many fellow Kenyans feel uncomfortable.
