riigi resented the insolence with which educated men presumed to instruct mbuci commanders. Parliament’s paper stole the authority of 274 i John M. Lonsdale face-to-face leadership, hard earned in the sharing of privation and dan- ger. readers were also cowards; Kimathi was said never to have fought in battle. Their Christianity, too, made literates despise the Gikuyu tradi- tions that inspired the rank and file. Finally, when they looked to the fu- ture for which all were fighting, riigi believed the educated would enjoy privileges and powers denied to the unlettered itungati by whose blood they would have been bought. according to Karari njama, Parliament possessed a comprehensive rebuttal of these householder protests. in the modern world, first, the pen was mightier than the sword. second, ideas set down on paper outlived the writer’s death and so outweighed personality. in any case, third, personality tended to divide, ideas had the power to unite. Finally, some structure of command was essential. riigi might think they were protecting the authority owed to each mbuci leader. such householder sovereignty may once have been a virtue in the struggle against nature, but today it crippled collective resistance to unjust power.81 Kimathi’s Parliament followed the logic of state building, Mathenge’s riigi spoke up for moral economy. This fundamental disagreement clearly gave Kimathi good reason to go armed, his supposedly lawful excuse. The conflict between riigi and Parliament took at least three forms fatal to his leadership and, in the end, his life. riigi men, first, were quicker than Kimathi to take up british offers of surrender talks, an initiative that infuriated him and intensified mutual suspicion between leaders.82 sec- ond, superintendent Henderson got his best intelligence in his hunt for Kimathi from riigi deserters, one of whom had been flogged for sleeping with a woman.
