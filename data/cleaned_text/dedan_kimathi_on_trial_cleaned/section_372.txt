First, like all subjects coming out of a violent history, Kenyans live under the fear that recalling the recent past will only remind them of the wrongs of history, its divi- sions, and its recent misfortunes.25 second, there is the difficulty of figur- ing a way to represent a figure like Kimathi outside the prison house of colonial discourse. For if the postcolonial elite is the heir to colonial institutions, they cannot separate their new role, which is essentially that of governmental- ity, from an inherited anti-Mau Mau discourse. Matters are further com- plicated by the fact that even when the elite seems to desire forgetting as the condition of its newness, it still finds it difficult to shake off the past. Dedan Kimathi: The Floating Signifier and the Missing Body i 323 indeed, one of the great ironies of Kenyan decolonization is what one may call a belated discourse of history in which colonial past and postcolonial futures meet each other at a discursive junction. Consider this: the Cor- field report, The Origins and Growth of Mau Mau, the official historical survey of the nationalist movement, is published in 1960, the year the state of emergency ends; J. M. Kariuki’s “Mau Mau” Detainee, considered to be the first account from inside the nationalist movement, is published in 1963. Corfield seems to want to lock the national narrative in a time that is passed; Kariuki wants to move the story forward, but he cannot do so without coming to terms with the past. The result is a discursive impasse. Within this impasse, attempts to imagine Kimathi are caught between a recalcitrant colonial authority and postcolonial anxiety.
