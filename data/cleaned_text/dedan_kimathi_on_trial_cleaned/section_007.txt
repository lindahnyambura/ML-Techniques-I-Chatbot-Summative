The only complimentary detail that emerges—ironically meant as negative—is the complaint by all Kĩmathi’s interrogators, who accuse him of refusing to cooperate or to divulge any security details about the Move- ment. For instance, John Charles edward Vidler, asP, an officer in charge of the Kenyan CiD, nyeri area (with twenty-two years of service), notes, “i have interviewed the accused in custody about other security matters not connected with this offence. He may have had useful information but gave none,” adding, “He spoke to me throughout in very good english.” similarly, John roger blackman, CiD inspector (with five years of service), reports, “subsequently i interviewed him to see if he could give me secu- rity information in respect to other matters. He did not assist me at all. . . . The impression that the accused gave me was that he could assist me in giving information, but he was obstinate and would not do so.” but despite this clear documentation of Kĩmathi’s refusal to cooper- ate with the colonial legal system, a document, purported to be Dedan Kĩmathi’s statement to the police under questioning, is filed in court. The statement is so systematically organized and logically presented with dates, locations, and all, that it reads more like a polished report crafted from carefully researched information than a statement put together from verbal information by the prisoner. since we hear from Kĩmathi’s inter- rogators that he was uncooperative, when and to whom was this statement made, we ask? in our view, it is most likely yet another colonial fabrication. a glance at some of the documents and the discrepancies, contradic- tions, and fallacies in them corroborates our conclusion about colonial fabrications against which vigilance is called for: • Most of the seven witnesses for the prosecution are former members of the notorious british auxiliary army but which the colonial state misleadingly named the Home Guard.
