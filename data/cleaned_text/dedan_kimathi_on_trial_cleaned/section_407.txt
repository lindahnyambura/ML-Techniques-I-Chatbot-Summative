its main tasks were to canvass public opinion nationwide on who ought to be recognized as a hero or heroine, draw up criteria for their identification, and develop a national Heroes and Heroines square. This latter plan was later modified, with the idea of a square replaced with a Heroes’ acre in uhuru Gardens, nairobi. This was in turn downsized to plans for a He- roes’ Corner in uhuru Park, which has not materialized. but in the park’s Freedom Corner, the country’s first Mau Mau memorial was officially un- veiled on 12 september 2015 (photo 10). Thousands of veterans, many of them bused in from former Central Province, turned out in bespoke red- and-white T-shirts bearing the slogan “shujaa wa Mau Mau” (Mau Mau heroes).74 beyond irony, the memorial was funded by the british govern- ment as part of the london reparations settlement. High Commissioner Christian Turner declared at the opening, “The memorial is a symbol of 350 i Lotte Hughes reconciliation between the uK, the Mau Mau and all those who suffered during the emergency period,” a sentiment previously expressed by the KHrC on its website.75 This is the first time to my knowledge that “all” vic- tims have been acknowledged publicly. one of several plaques which form components of the memorial repeats this statement almost word for word, substituting “the british Government” for “the uK” and omitting the word “period.” However, local media coverage does not appear to have men- tioned the crucial word “all.” if the slogans worn that day were anything to go by, veterans did not get the message either; in their eyes, the memorial commemorates their heroism rather than being a marker of reconcilia- tion. Will non–Mau Mau regard the memorial as inclusive of them? i find this highly doubtful.
