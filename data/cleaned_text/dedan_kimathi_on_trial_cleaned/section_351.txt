The sworn silence, and wish by some key colonial officials and some in london to keep mum about misdeeds, missteps, and, indeed, the cruel and heartless commission of evils while countering the mili- tant Mau Mau, met its irreverent end at last. The sins that the Kenyan attorney general Griffiths-Jones had so wished, as indicated in a 1957 memorandum, to keep secret, were ultimately laid bare.

The dark and eerie back room of memory of events in the past, whether private or collective, is one that we, as human beings—whoever and wherever we may be, academics, the general public, in institutions, in governments, or acting as nations—rarely want to venture into, and one, when we dare, we are scarcely able to deal with without succumbing to the temptation of moving things around. We find that we must rearrange memory to suit our present tastes; to allay fears that the past can visit upon the present; to avoid culpabil- ity or being held to account; and to redeem ourselves, reputations, and self- respect. in countries that have experienced intensely divisive conflict or gross violation of human rights and human dignity—such as Guatemala, which ex- perienced a civil war that lasted slightly over three decades; Cambodia, which experienced one of the world’s worst internal genocides in the 1970s; the long history of conflict in northern ireland; and apartheid in south africa—has led to deep-seated social divisions usually accompanied by grief or a certain restlessness about the past. The ultimate result is the emergence of a memory of silence or fiery contestation about how the past ought to be remembered or interpreted.
