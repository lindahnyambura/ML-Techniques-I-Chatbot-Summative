it was con- sidered controversial even before it opened, several images were removed on government orders because they were deemed offensive to “one side 354 i Lotte Hughes or the other,” and a much-reduced exhibit (photographs with no accom- panying text) was mysteriously removed altogether in the mid-1990s.93 nothing more was done to address the heritage of liberation struggle until the nMK began planning a permanent History of Kenya exhibition in 2005, which includes a room dedicated to “armed struggle.”94 (originally the nMK also planned a traveling exhibition on “Kenya independence struggles,” which would have included earlier anticolonial rebellions; this was aborted.)95 Historically, given its colonial rootedness in paleontology, archaeology, and the natural world, the institution appears to have felt much more comfortable with the far distant past and “non-controversial subjects.”96 The armed struggle space includes cabinets displaying Kimathi’s im- probably outsized shorts, leather jacket, the uncropped photograph of him on a stretcher just after capture, his pistol, and a few letters (e.g., to General China); a display of homemade Mau Mau guns, which is from observation particularly popular with visiting schoolboys; a video made by nMK staff that plays continually in a loop, featuring interviews with war veterans;97 a map of the detention camps; the bullet that lodged in General China’s chest for thirty-four years; and photographs of achieng’ oneko, bildad Kaggia, and Paul ngei (why not the entire Kapenguria six?) with a cap- tion describing them as “the militant leaders of the Mau Mau movement” rather than members of the militant wing of the Kenya african union; and a photograph of the body of senior Chief Waruhiu, with no explanation as to why Mau Mau murdered him, triggering the declaration of a state of emergency, in october 1952.
