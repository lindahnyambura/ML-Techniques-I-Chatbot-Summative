your Petitioner was granted a certificate of the learned Chief Justice that the case was a fit one for appeal on grounds involving fact or mixed law and fact under section 378 of the Criminal Procedure Code, although it appears from the record that the said certificate was granted “dubitante” {doubtful}. The said section, so far as material, provides as follows ) 378. (1) any person convicted on a trial held by the su- preme Court may appeal to His Majesty’s Court of appeal for eastern africa – (a) against his conviction on any ground of appeal which in- volves a question of law alone; and (b) with the leave of such Court of appeal or upon the cer- tificate of the judge who tried him that it is a fit case for appeal on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal; and (c) with the leave of such Court of appeal against the sentence passed on conviction unless such sentence is one fixed by law. 12. THaT your Petitioner’s grounds of appeal were as follows – 1. That having regard to the fundamental principle of self-de- fence the learned Chief Justice erred in directing himself and the assessors to the effect that if the appellant’s sole purpose in carrying the pistol (the subject matter of the charge) was to protect his life from terrorists, such purpose could not in law afford a “lawful excuse” within the meaning of regula- tion 8a (1) of the emergency regulations 1952. 2. That the learned Chief Justice erred in law in directing the 168 i Document 4 assessors to the effect that in order to constitute a “law- ful excuse” within the meaning of regulation 8a (1) it was necessary for the appellant to have done “overt acts” (other than the single act of carrying the pistol for the purpose of surrendering it) in pursuance of his intention to surrender. 3.
