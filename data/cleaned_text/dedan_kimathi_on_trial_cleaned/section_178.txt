The entry wound was on the inner aspect of the right thigh, high up near the crutch: the exit wound was on the outer side of the hip above the knob of the thigh bone. The projecting part of the bone had been shattered, but the continuity of the thigh bone had not been broken. The path of the bullet was distinctly upwards. Mr Hurley operated and the accused stood the operation very well. on Monday 22nd october, Mr Hurley examined the accused for the purpose of ascertaining whether he was fit to be interviewed by the Police.

The accused was interviewed by acting senior superintendent baker who cautioned, and in the presence of a Magistrate, charged him with the present charges. The accused speaks very good 142 i Document 2 english. The charges were read to him in english, swahili and Kikuyu. He replied: “i would like to say that i never knew that there was such a law”. He then told the interpreter that he wanted to think. after about 20 seconds he added: “i have nothing more to say”. From first to last, neither to sergeant Mwangi, Corporal Wanjohi, inspector sloan, Mr Hurley, nor superintendent baker did the accused say one word about having come in to surrender, and he made no complaint that he had been shot while trying to surrender.
