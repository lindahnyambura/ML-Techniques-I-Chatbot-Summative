so were the british not only Philistines but also the avenging men of Gog, and in due course would their oppressions, like Gog’s, cause their kingdom to be given away? These are questions impossible to answer, but would Kimathi have carried his bible, as he did, and not have read it and wondered? in July or august 1953 the onetime teacher Kimathi usurped the lead- ership of the ex-soldier stanley Mathenge, first overall commander in the nyandarua forest. Karari njama, secretary now to Kimathi, was also a teacher. such men, a second generation of readers, athomi, called the for- est war to order on paper by devising a hierarchy of command, set over named units in battle formation.78 They embodied this organization in the “Kenya Parliament,” for which an imposing bamboo meeting hall was built high in the forest.79 literacy was essential for communication by courier, with trees serving as postboxes; it also countered the british propaganda that Mau Mau was a bestial reversion to a supposedly barbarous past. but, as in both the 1929 “female circumcision crisis” and in the tension between the landed network of mbari and muhimu’s nominal roll, the authority of paperwork could be questioned. Mathenge, with the charisma of one who had seen Jerusalem when in the british army, led the opposition to Kimathi’s Parliament.80 His dis- senting mbuci leaders thought of themselves as the less educated but still needed paper—and a secretary in Kahinga Wachanga. The name they gave themselves said everything. it epitomized their constitutional opposition to written orders from officious superiors. They were the Kenya riigi, a group that took its name from the outer gate that none but the house- holder should close. it secured domestic civility against the wild, protected self-mastery and defended, now, against the arrogance of paper. The riigi certainly threatened Kimathi; Wachanga called him a dic- tator.
