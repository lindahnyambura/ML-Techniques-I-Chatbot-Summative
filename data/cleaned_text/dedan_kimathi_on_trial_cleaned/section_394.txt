The veterans concerned are predominantly Gikuyu, and their narratives echo much earlier communal grievances, and reflect internal divisions, that date back at least as far as Gikuyu submissions to the Kenya land Commission (1932–34), if not much earlier. Histories and memories of the conflict and movement have not been forgotten, though some narratives remain submerged, repressed, or heavily (sometimes self-) edited.12 How- ever, far less scholarly attention has been paid to discussion and analysis of the memory and memorialization of Mau Mau, compared to the extensive historiography. reasons for these lacunae may include some historians’ wariness of the notoriously slippery canon of memory, and disciplinary boundaries between history and memory studies, though these are be- coming more porous. Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 341 at the time of writing, yet another example of the “forgetting” trope has appeared in the Daily Nation. under the headline “rewriting the Mau Mau story,” the reporter accuses retired british diplomats of “retroactively censoring” historical documents on Mau Mau held in uK archives, thereby destroying “evidence” that veterans require to bring future claims.13 He ends by stating, “it won’t be long until the last of the veterans dies. Perhaps the british government will breathe a sigh of relief when that happens. Per- haps the Kenyan government will no longer need to deal with the messy business that is the place of Mau Mau in the history of Kenya. Perhaps the legacy of these fighters who fought for a land they never gained will never be forgotten, because it was never remembered.”14 Here i try to describe and periodize how and why memory practices and “regimes of memory,”15 centered on Mau Mau, simultaneously fea- ture “forgetting,” occlusion, absences, contradictions, and often a surfeit of memory.
