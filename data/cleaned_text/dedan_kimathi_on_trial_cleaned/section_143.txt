he didn’t know that Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 111 that law applied to a person who was coming in to surrender in accordance with terms of the pamphlet {leaflet}. He could have explained this to Vidler. He says he didn’t know he was a police officer. He was not in police uniform. The statement to baker was less than 24 hours after the accused had been operated on. Dr. Hurley said that accused was suffering from shock and that his wound was not a painful one. you have heard evidence of his mother and J. Wakaba which confirms that he is an epileptic. you have heard Turner say that one of the results of epilepsy in circumstances of shock is to blunt the mental qualities of the subject and that it does in many cases lead to insanity. i am not suggesting that accused is insane but there is a lot to be discovered and who can say where insanity begins. i suggest that in considering the circumstances in which the accused failed to make plain that he was coming in to surrender which was surely the first thing that any intelligent person would have done, the accused had he been clear of mind and normal would have said “i came in to surrender” to all persons he met subsequent to his shooting. before the operation he had been injected and was as Vidler said semi-conscious. same day he was operated on. 10.30 baker took a statement. He had been under anaesthetics less than 24 hours before: he was still suffering pain and you must consider the possibility of his epilepsy in those conditions affecting his mind. He himself said that he had a painful headache, was in pain and feeling giddy. How would anyone feel fit to consider all circumstances of such a charge. another circumstance: you have heard how accused sent various letters to Government. He says that that brought about dissension between himself and the other leaders and that he had to flee and hide.
