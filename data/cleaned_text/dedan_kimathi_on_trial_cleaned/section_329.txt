Kimathi’s stature and resistance was achieved through an ever-widening circle of identity formation. The inner concentric circle of who he was con- sisted of his core self-identity shaped by personal experiences; a world of private thoughts and secret aspirations; and essential political values and beliefs. The second concentric circle of Kimathi’s identity was defined by his relationships with, and organization of, like-minded key figures that he knew face-to-face (read: Mau Mau forest fighters). The third outer con- centric circle of his identity was based on his understanding of, and ap- peal to, a solidaristic collective organization from which he drew upon the consciously organized resources of a social movement in pursuit of his individual agency. and, lastly, although this is where he floundered, was the outermost concentric circle consisting of his attempts to involve the organizational capacities of generalized agencies such as other global liberation movements and exemplars of revolution and their publications, and local and international media, which he read or knew only remotely, through their representations.39 in the first concentric circle of Kimathi’s organization of resistance was a deep-seated resistance consciousness the spring of which was suf- ficient self-cognizance to enable him to act as a coherently organized individual or to exercise reflexive agency in power relations.
