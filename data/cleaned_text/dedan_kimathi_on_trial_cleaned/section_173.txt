any ammunition in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that such ammunition,..... are intended to be used in a manner or for a purpose prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for life”. it will be observed that both the regulations under which the accused is charged, cast the burden of proof of lawful authority or lawful excuse upon the accused. This (except in special case where the defence is insanity) is a most unusual position in a criminal case; but the wording of the regulations is clear and unambiguous and i must follow it. i have, therefore, directed the assessors, and i direct myself, that, upon count 1, the burden of proving: (a) that at the place and time mentioned, the accused had the revolver described in his possession; and (b) that it is a “firearm” as defined; rests upon the prosecution; and that the burden of proving that he had a lawful authority or lawful excuse rests upon the accused. i have also directed the assessors, and i direct myself, that, upon count 2, the burden of proving that the accused had six rounds of .38 calibre ammunition (as defined), in his possession and that the circumstances were such as to raise a reasonable presumption that such ammunition was intended to be used in a manner or for a 138 i Document 2 purpose prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of public order rests or for a purpose prejudicial to the public safety and upon the prosecution; and that the burden of proving lawful authority or lawful excuse rests upon the accused. and i have directed the assessors (and myself) that the degree of proof where the burden rests upon the prosecution is proof beyond reasonable doubt; but that the standard of proof, where the burden rests upon the accused, is a mere balance of probabilities. The accused does not allege that he had lawful authority to possess either the revolver or the ammunition.
