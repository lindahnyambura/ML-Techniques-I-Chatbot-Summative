His proffers of peace and appeals for redress of pressing african griev- ances; for the colonial authorities to rely less on coercion or fear, and more on truth; for mutual trust, respect and friendship, and mutuality in giving and acceptance; for shared prosperity while appreciating that all people cannot be rich; for the need for healing and reconciliation; for peace and mutual coexistence, and the expression of hope that blacks and whites in 300 i Nicholas Kariuki Githuku Kenya be of one heart; and for justice and truth, came to naught. indeed, what he represented, the truth of the weak spoken in the face of power, was inadmissible and unacceptable. Kimathi’s insubordination against the constituted colonial order and its laws, and the insurrection that he had led, had breached the bounds of established rules of structured consensual interaction, including whatever conflict existed between the imperial au- thorities and their “lawful” african subjects. His war sought to reconfig- ure the socioeconomic formation of the state; the political order within it; and its power structure.73 The violence and its envisioned objectives went beyond ordered conflict within the structured rules of interaction that co- lonial authorities oversaw. What is more, Kimathi’s truth and knowledge were at loggerheads with the ideas and beliefs that had (re)produced the colonial political, economic, and social structure. structurally, what Kimathi stood for was dangerous to the systemic colonial structure and had to be rooted out and crushed.74 What Kimathi stood for was, therefore, feared by, and undesir- able for, the colonial authorities. He was the paragon of radical and revo- lutionary thought that demanded far-reaching reforms and fundamental decolonization. The door to this “dangerous” road had to be firmly shut, even if it meant granting flag and political independence to Kenya.
