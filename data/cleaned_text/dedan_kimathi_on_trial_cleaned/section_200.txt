Turner, the Provincial Physician also says that the accused is an epileptic and he says that anaesthesia and operations are well know precipitating causes of fits, an epileptic may have a fit as a result of an anaesthetic and an operation. This would not be noticed if it occurred during anaesthesia. if an epileptic had a fit during anaesthesia, it would be likely that he would have a severe headache and mental blurring for some hours after he recovered consciousness. These symptoms might last up to 48 hours. There is no evidence that he did in fact have a fit. There is no defence of insanity in this case. it is not suggested by the Defence that on the 21st october 1956 the mental condition of the accused was such that he did not know that he possessed a pistol and six rounds of ammunition or that, through disease affecting his mind, he did not know that such possession was illegal. The sole reason for this evidence of epilepsy is to try to account for the fact that, when charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, the accused did not, in so many words, say that he had the weapons because he was about to surrender and was bringing them in for that purpose.” 6. THaT the learned Chief Justice directed the assessors in rela- tion to your Petitioner’s defence that he was carrying the pistol and ammunition for the purpose of self-defence as follows – “i also direct you as a matter of law that it would not af- ford a reasonable excuse for one terrorist to carry a pistol and ammunition for the purpose of protecting himself from other terrorists whom he might have offended.” Appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom i 163 it is submitted that this is a misdirection. The issue raised by the defence was not whether there was a “reasonable excuse” for your Petitioner to carry a pistol and ammunition but whether there was a “lawful excuse” within the meaning of the regulation.
