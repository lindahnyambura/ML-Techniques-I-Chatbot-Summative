This is a possibility because of the amount of renewed interest that making the Kimathi trial and related documents available to the public will likely bring about. The public debate that arises from this haunting and stubborn past, if it does not degenerate into the politics of memory, will lead Kenyans to realize, more and more, that in their thought they argue the same issues, superficial ethnic boundaries notwithstand- ing.83 additionally, such a debate will, most assuredly, raise recriminations against what, in retrospect, will be perceived by Kenyans, as wrongful con- viction of one of Kenya’s freedom heroes, and that of many others, under an unjust and criminal colonial law. at the same time, Kimathi, and others who fell during the struggle, will be extricated from blame—not a small matter but one that must occa- sion great contention. as intimated earlier, this debate should ultimately be prudently judged on the basis of the fact that the law upon which free- dom fighters were convicted, was limited and contrary to fundamental law. now under inverse historical scrutiny, given the clarity afforded the public by time and the benefit of hindsight, is the legal validity or legiti- macy of, not only the particular legal provision used to convict Kimathi, but also colonial laws in general owing to their questionable sociological construction. Moreover, availability of this previously hidden archival in- formation in the public domain will draw attention to the historical and political context.
