britain and Kenya are, of necessity, embroiled in an uneasy tango with a critical past; and that gargantuan task calls for honest, memory-thrashing work.4 such memory work is never simple. yet it is not the only thing that needs urgent attention or a coming to terms with britain’s and Kenya’s past. While the need for a far-reaching engagement with this important specific past is vital, it is crucial to go beyond legal suits and commemora- tions. The long-awaited and broader expectation of the rectification of his- torical injustices and reinstitution of social justice, is a critical matter that lies at the heart of the popular quest for statehood and the nation-building imperative. This is a critical task that requires many hands at the helm, including scholars from various disciplines and, importantly, political leaders in london and in nairobi. such is the seriousness of this unfold- ing complex historical entanglement of britain and Kenya evident in these dramatic spills of the past into the present. yet the best and most critical of these spills of the past into the present has waited to enter last into this crucial breaking of hitherto hidden histories into the present: the recov- ery of the court transcripts of the trial of freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi, and affiliated documents, including two appeals to the court of appeals for eastern africa and to the privy council filed by Frederick Henry Miller, lead counsel for the defense. This archival find thrusts this important his- torical figure right to the center of british imperial history in Kenya. once more, the fortuitous discovery of this hitherto “inexistent” cru- cial document pierces the deliberate official silence of many years, and adds to the delicately sprouting but determined shoot of revealing hidden The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 285 histories now thrust into the open.
