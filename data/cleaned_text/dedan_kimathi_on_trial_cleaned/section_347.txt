after all, it is obvious that, while the accused may have broken the colonial government’s emergency laws, the policies of that The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 305 government—its racial oppression, intolerance of constitutional african opposition and even peaceful dissent, tyranny, ill-treatment, exploitation and denigration of black people, rule through force, and african poverty and absence of human dignity entrenched by legislation84—left Kimathi and forest fighters with no choice other than violent resistance. yet, it is evident from the trial transcripts that this went unprobed. This politico- legal anomaly and oversight is open to question. When, to what extent, and why did the colonial legal architecture flout natural and fundamental law thus severely constraining the freedom and well-being of imperial subjects who suffered subsequent legal disabil- ity? Considering the inherent legal defect of colonial laws, were freedom fighters obligated to obey the law? and, in hindsight, and in light of the foregoing questions, was the punishment meted out to them justified? one might even dare to suppose that penetrating legal arguments will find and extract a posthumous admission from Kenya’s erstwhile imperial rulers that there was a gross miscarriage of justice. Might there also be a post- humous exoneration issued by the Kenyan state and from britain as well?85 only time can tell. but time alone cannot make any reliable determination without an appreciable measure of moral probity in Kenyans’ collective introspection and scrupulous examination of this regrettable past. These difficult questions call for a thorough, sobering, and critical view, and thrashing out of the shared past between Kenya and britain with an appre- ciable measure of moral probity. The serious task of coming to terms with the past lies ahead of us all: intellectuals, the general public, or policy- makers.
