Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 79 on Monday the 22/10 i again examined him between 8.30 and 9.30 a.m. i thought his mental condition was clear and normal. one of the purposes of my examination was to form an opinion whether he might be seen by the police. His physical condition was at that time reasonably comfortable. i formed the opinion that it was quite reasonable for the police to speak to him. He had not been given any drugs that a.m. He had been given drugs the day before for his operation. The effect of those drugs had worn off by the Monday. He had been given anti-tetanus, etc., injections. They would not affect his mental condition. When i spoke to him he did not complain. i asked him some direct questions. He mentioned that his leg was sore, difficult to move and uncomfortable when moved. He complained that he could not pass urine. i relieved that condition for him. after my examination i spoke to baker of the C.i.D. i understood that he was going to speak to D. Kimathi. after he had seen baker i inspected the patient again. His condition had not deteriorated in any way. Cross-eXaMinaTion: The operation on the accused on the 21/10 was over about 12.50 as far as i can estimate. i went on to perform another operation. The bullet hit the inner side of the thigh and came out higher up at the back. The exit wound was a little over 3” higher than the entry wound. i should point out that the exit wound would be affected by the bullet having struck the bone and the bullet would revolve (spin).
