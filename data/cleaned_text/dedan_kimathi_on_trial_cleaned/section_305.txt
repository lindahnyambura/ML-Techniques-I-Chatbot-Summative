as a student of shakespeare, ngũgĩ imagined the tyrant Moi kept sleepless by his fear of “the unavenged father’s ghost of Kimathi’s struggle and his Kenya land Freedom army.” The memory of Mau Mau was cer- tainly subversive in the context of the 1980s. but memory can serve con- tradictory purposes, in response to the changing context of the present day.86 under Moi the opponents of autocracy could look to Mau Mau for inspiration, as Prince Hamlet had looked to his father’s ghost. More re- cently that same memory has been recast, to act in an opposing role, that of the sacrificial support, the historical justification, for what many see as the self-serving regime in power.87 That is the problem with today’s context for searching the past. Tomorrow’s today will inevitably be different. its history may have to differ too. yet, to insist, the foreign country of the past had its own lives, not always the same ones we find interesting or useful, each with their own anxieties and conflicts, endured and disputed with reference to still earlier remembered pasts. under the stern eye of their own remembered history, Kimathi’s forest fighters were obsessed with the seeming impossibility of achieving the responsible adulthood that their ancestors required of them. and how, in their turn, could they the childless be remembered? Fearing to die unmarried, reputation was the only descendant they could hope to generate. but the reputation that mattered most was the one that seemed beyond reach, that of propertied self-mastery, summed up as ithaka na wiathi, their unattainable self-description. it was the conventional ambi- tion, shared between itungati and kamatimu. it was what both fought for, intimates but enemies; that was what made the war so brutal, so tragic. no civil war has ever simply aligned the honest, earnest, champions of the people against the crooked, heartless, servants of despotism. opponents often turn out to be twins.
