a new rwimbo portrayed Kimathi as Moses, ascending the mountain alone. some said the british, modern Philistines, had sent the giant Goliath against them.73 in June 1953, Karari njama, then secre- tary to the unlettered stanley Mathenge, read aloud from the book of Lam- entations. His itungati audience agreed that they shared the slavery israel had suffered in babylon. njama reassured them: “Then don’t be worried of what has become of us, saying that this is strange news you had never seen or heard of before. you have already heard it from the israelites. it has hap- pened to many other races and nations. it is History and History repeats itself. it is our turn now. all you have to do is persevere and fight bravely.”74 in his letter of october 1954, Kimathi took a similar text as an inspira- tion to Gikuyu and a warning for the british: “in reading the history of the israelites we also read the history of the Gikuyu. For there is one God for black and white and he rules the evil and the righteous together, for God is the ruler who is great. He always gives away the kingdom of the one who seeks to suppress.”75 one can only speculate, for lack of private papers, but it is tempting to imagine that Kimathi read into his bible not only Gikuyu history but also his own, a onetime son of the scottish mission. The scots Mau Mau’s Debates on Trial i 273 had a list of approved baptismal names, Dedan among them, and urged adherents to learn about their namesakes.76 The biblical Dedan was both a man, of the lineage of noah or abraham and, later, a clan. This clan, with other “young lions,” defeated the tyrant King Gog, who had devastated the land at a time when israel had offended their God with their unclean- ness (thahu) and transgressions (kwagarara watho).77 in common with others, Kimathi the dairy clerk had once asked himself if Gikuyu were unclean.
