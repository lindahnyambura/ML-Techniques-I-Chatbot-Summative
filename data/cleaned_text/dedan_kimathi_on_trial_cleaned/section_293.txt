urban workers suffered rapid inflation; mechanization prompted white farmers to extinguish the tenancy rights of their workers, their “squatters,” over one-quarter of the Gikuyu people; the stiff tenurial rules on new peasant settlement schemes shattered household self-determination.49 The Kau’s moderate nationalists exercised as little persuasive power as elders; a gov- ernment investing in fresh white settlement paid them little attention. Gikuyu began to build local solidarities with oaths of unity that promised defense against despair. as usual, opinion divided; many elders thought that such heavy legal responsibility should not be laid on weak women and unmarried, untested men. in the next stumble toward war, the gov- ernment soothed settler fears by banning these oaths and the movement gathering behind them, a determined new leadership that emerged within the Kau. some of them contemplated violence: trade unionists familiar with the criminals of outcast nairobi, traders, lorry owners, taxi drivers, office clerks.
