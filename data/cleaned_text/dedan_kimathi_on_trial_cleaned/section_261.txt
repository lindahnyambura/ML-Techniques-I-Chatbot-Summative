Police officers took separate statements from the accused that were specifically intended for use in the courtroom—Kimathi was interviewed by a police officer on 22 october 1956, when in the hos- pital and still recovering from the surgery on his wound,37 more than a week before he met with Dunn, on 31 october 1956, to conduct the formal special branch interrogation. Police “evidence” intended for the trial was therefore collected in an entirely separate process from interrogations of key prisoners that were intended for intelligence purposes, and would be added to the database gathered and analyzed by staff at the Mau Mau in- terrogation Centre.38 interrogation reports were never attested in the same legal way required for a statement to be used in court. Moreover, inter- rogation reports were likely to contain information that might be used operationally, and so to allow such matters to be presented in court might risk the integrity of any future actions by the security forces. The choice of judicial staff for the case was both surprising and reveal- ing of british attitudes and apprehensions. sir Kenneth o’Connor was se- lected as the judge to hear the case. o’Connor was Kenya’s chief justice and one of several prominent irish-trained colonial-service lawyers.39 He was the most senior judge then in Kenya, yet he had very limited experience of the special emergency assizes or of Mau Mau cases. Justices serving in these courts would normally hear several cases in a single day and take sittings at circuits lasting more than a week, yet since returning to Kenya in 1954 the archive records show that o’Connor had presided in only three special emergency assize hearings, all in nairobi. in these cases o’Connor acquitted one accused and convicted four others.
