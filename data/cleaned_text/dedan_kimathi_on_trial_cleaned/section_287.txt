each hybrid people had to argue out the tolerably unequal terms of moral economy that enabled them to live in their particular environ- ment: forest, hill, desert, or prairied plain. These ecological ethnicities then became still more vigorous debating societies under british rule, with new “dealings” to discuss. alien rule and its african roots, mission literacy (especially for daughters), migrant labor, and rural capitalism all tested the conventional civic virtues of household duty and mutual reciprocity. argument raised self-consciousness. The boundaries of these ethnic moral economies, moral ethnicities, tended to be confirmed rather than created by the “tribal” administrative districts of colonial rule. Moral debate also raised a strategic question: might political recog- nition resolve internal difference? That was the issue of the 1920s, espe- cially, again, for Gikuyu. Police firepower had killed nairobi’s multiethnic energy in the “Thuku troubles” of 1922, but in 1923 the british appeared to repent, with their “Devonshire declaration” that Kenya was primarily an african, not a white man’s, country. london made this statement to calm conflict between Kenya’s british and indian immigrants, not to ap- pease african unrest but what struck one Johnstone Kenyatta was that political concession had followed violent repression, a seemingly causal sequence he never forgot.28 it encouraged Gikuyu “readers,” Christian athomi, who drank tea rather than beer, to work for imperial recogni- tion by pursuing “progress,” a collective means to win the civic virtue previously earned by the costly public energy shown by prosperous, po- lygamous households.
