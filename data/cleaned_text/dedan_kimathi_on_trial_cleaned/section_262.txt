one of these convictions, that of a female accomplice of an oath administrator, was overturned on appeal, while two other death sentences were commuted.40 Dedan Kimathi would therefore be only the second Mau Mau convict who would go to the gallows after being sentenced by o’Connor.41 if o’Connor’s appoint- ment was therefore surprising, given his lack of previous involvement in Mau Mau cases, it clearly revealed the importance attached to the case by the british in Kenya. Cases were normally simply added to the circuit list for the nyeri courtroom, and Kimathi would have been tried by whatever judge was assigned to the court at that time. but o’Connor would come to 244 i David M. Anderson nyeri only to hear the Kimathi case: as the senior government legal officer, this case was seen to be his responsibility. a similarly careful and high-profile approach was taken in the selec- tion of the Crown’s prosecuting counsel. Diarmaid Conroy was the most experienced state prosecutor available, having over previous years acted in many important cases. but like o’Connor, he rarely appeared in court by 1956, being by then fully absorbed in his administrative roles as solicitor general and minister of legal affairs in the colonial government of Kenya. Dusting off his robes and wig for the nyeri appearance, Conroy would be assisted by the most highly regarded and competent junior prosecu- tor then working in the legal Department, J. K. Havers—who would later in his colonial career rise to the post of attorney general in Gibraltar. sir Diarmaid Conroy, CMG, obe, as he became, went on to serve as chief justice in northern rhodesia as Kenneth Kaunda led the country to in- dependence, before returning to the lord Chancellor’s office in the uK as President of industrial Tribunals, during the difficult years of the 1960s and 1970s. This was a formidable prosecution team.
