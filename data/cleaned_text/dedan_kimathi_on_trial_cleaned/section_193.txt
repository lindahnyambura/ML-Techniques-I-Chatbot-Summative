(2) The learned Chief Justice misdirected the assessors and himself that in order to constitute a “lawful excuse” within Appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom i 157 the meaning of regulation 8a on the ground that he was intending to bring in the pistol and the ammunition in or- der to surrender them to the proper authorities in response to the invitation in surrender leaflets, it was necessary for your Petitioner to have done “overt acts” in pursuance of that intention. (3) The learned Chief Justice misdirected the assessors and himself in that while he directed them that a surrender leaf- let which had been withdrawn by the Government before the date of the alleged offences could not provide a “lawful excuse” to your Petitioner unless he was unaware it had been withdrawn, he failed to direct them that the defence of “lawful excuse” would be open to a person who intended to surrender even if there had been no surrender leaflet. (4) The learned Chief Justice misdirected the assessors and himself that your Petitioner’s alleged omission to state, when charged, that he was coming in to surrender could give rise to an inference that your Petitioner’s said defence was untrue. The Chief Justice further erred in inferring from your Petitioner’s alleged omission to state, at any time before the trial, that he was coming in to surrender, that this defence was untrue. (5) The learned Chief Justice having for good reason rejected or at least doubted the evidence of the chief prosecution witness, ndirangu on a material question, viz. the exact circumstances in which your Petitioner was shot and wounded, erred in accepting the uncorroborated evidence of that witness that your Petitioner had not, before he was shot, stated that he had come in to surrender. (6) The appeal ought not to have been dismissed summarily by order of a single judge of the Court of appeal without a hearing. 7. THaT the material facts alleged in evidence at the trial were in outline as follows.
