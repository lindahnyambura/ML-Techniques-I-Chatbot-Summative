if you think (1) that Dedan Kimathi was in possession of this pistol, (2) that it could hurt or kill a person  unless he had a lawful authority or lawful excuse for possessing it, he is guilty on count 1. if you are satisfied of that and that there were 6 rounds in the pistol, you may think him guilty of the 2nd charge.

The relief plan is drawn to scale in order that the Court may have an idea of the distance. The plan at the foot is not to scale. Ditch runs alongside of valley.

From where ditch joins road to bottom of valley might be 300 to 400 ft, but difference in altitude. Q. if you are on that hillside below the ditch looking up you would be looking up rather sharply: it is a steep slope? a. yes. The distance from a to D is between 2,300 and 2,500 ft., i.e. about 800 . no re-examination. To Court. Ditch is reasonably flat-bottomed.
