i find it incredible that if he had, as he now says, been shot while trying to surrender, he would not have said so and made some protest on the numerous occasions when he was interviewed by persons in authority. i find that the Prosecution have established beyond reasonable doubt that on 21st october, 1956, the accused had in his possession the Webley scott revolver and the six rounds of ammunition which are the subject respectively of charges 1 and 2: that the revolver is a firearm within the meaning of regulation 8a(4) and that the ammunition is ammunition as defined. i find that the accused was a member of a terrorist organisation – Mau Mau – and had the ammunition in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable presumption that it was intended to be used for a purpose prejudicial to public safety and the maintenance of public order. The accused has not shown that it is more probable than not that he possessed the revolver or the ammunition or both because he was coming in to surrender in response to surrender leaflet and was bringing them for that purpose. i do not believe the surrender story and i think it is an after-thought and a fabrication. The accused has not shown on balance of probabilities that he had a reasonable excuse for possession of the arms and ammunition. i agree with the unanimous opinions of the assessors and convict the accused on both counts. Finally, i desire to say that i regret the necessity of holding this trial before the accused was fully recovered from his wound. The accused was, however, medically certified, before the trial commenced, as being fit to stand his trial, and i have repeatedly indicated that if at any time he felt unfit and wished for an adjournment, one would be granted; but i have been told by his Counsel that he felt sufficiently fit and wished to proceed. He has been under constant medical supervision during the trial and i have watched him constantly for any signs of pain or discomfort.
