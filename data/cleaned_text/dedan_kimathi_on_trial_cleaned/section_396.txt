The british official description of the movement as ata- vistic, tribalist, racist, anti-Christian, and criminal, issued at the beginning 342 i Lotte Hughes of the emergency in october 1952, set the tone for most european commen- tary on Mau Mau over the next eight years.”20 Mau Mau skillfully counterat- tacked in the propaganda war.21 but six months into the emergency, the lari massacre gave british propagandists an opportunity to up their game—and snuff out news of the daring, highly successful Mau Mau raid on the naiva- sha police station, which had taken place the same night.22 The circulation of gory images of massacre victims was central to this effort; besides pho- tographs used in leaflets and so on, footage of lari was also taken to the Gikuyu reserves in a mobile cinema van.23 The propaganda campaign was successful in not only influencing british public attitudes toward Mau Mau, via the british media and newsreels, but also in repelling many Kenyans, including Gikuyu “waverers.”24 as Daniel branch describes it, “The massacre of loyalists at lari . . . played a critical role in the consolidation of an  opposition to Mau Mau that in 1953 dared not speak its name.”25 Devout Christians were particularly revolted by this violence, and it was the pho- tographs and film of mutilated bodies, especially of women and children, that burned into the public psyche.
