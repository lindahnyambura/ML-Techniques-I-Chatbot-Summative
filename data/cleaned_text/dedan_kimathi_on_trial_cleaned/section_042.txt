His silence after the capture stood out not only to british officials but moreover to local onlookers.101 after being read the charges against him, Kimathi stated, “i would like to say that i never knew there was such a law,” pausing for a few seconds and then adding, “i have nothing more to say.”102 The trial perhaps offers further insights, but Kimathi’s silence following his capture raises questions not only possibly about his own motivations and state of mind at the moment of capture but moreover about the possible colonial omissions or erasures of Kimathi’s voice during the period between cap- ture and trial, a point raised by Mũgo and ngũgĩ in their foreword. 18 i Julie MacArthur The british press reported Kimathi’s capture worldwide. The accom- panying photograph pictured Kimathi, stripped of his leopard skin coat and cap, from an extremely high angle, dreadlocks wound tight atop his head, as if a subdued animal or helpless infant (photos 2 and 3).103 a british Pathé newsreel video proclaimed to the world that the capture of Kimathi “will have a great psychological effect for the Mau Mau leaders still at large are only small fry. Without Kimathi, Mau Mau’s days are numbered.”104 The government distributed one hundred thousand leaflets throughout Central Kenya detailing how Kimathi was captured. special broadcasts announcing his capture were made with the aim of reaching “even the most remote and isolated villages in the emergency areas.”105 Kimathi’s capture also happened to coincide with the royal visit of Princess Margaret to Kenya, making Kimathi’s capture share the front page of the East Afri- can Standard on 22 october 1956 with full images of the princess’s arrival.
