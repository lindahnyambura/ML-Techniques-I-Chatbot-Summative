Keen not to offer a political platform for Kimathi, and aware of the dangers of making a martyr of the wounded rebel leader, the british adhered rigorously to the rules of the court while also ensuring that no obstruction was placed on Kimathi’s defense. Few other Mau Mau defendants had been treated with such courtesy and regard. To appreciate how the trial was conducted it is first important to un- derstand that although the special emergency assizes were a division of the supreme Court and heard capital cases, they functioned in a radically different way from that normally expected in a courtroom under british jurisdiction. These assize courts offered a stripped-down and truncated version of “british justice,” with the legal practicalities specifically shaped to the circumstances of a colonial war of insurrection. it is a striking para- dox of the special assize Courts that because they had been set up to deal specifically with Mau Mau crimes under emergency Powers there was sel- dom any attempt to establish the motive for a crime, even an act of murder, in the cases brought to trial. This avoided any discussion in court of the aims and objectives of Mau Mau as a movement, and so denied the accused any opportunity to present a political case. These cases are therefore all about Mau Mau, but Mau Mau is hardly ever mentioned in the proceedings. The background to the creation of the special emergency assizes and the character of their proceedings will be explained in the opening section of this chapter. The second section will then address the specifics of the 234 i David M. Anderson Kimathi trial, highlighting the distinctive aspects of the case. The conclu- sion reflects on the place of Kimathi’s trial in the wider history of the Mau Mau insurrection, and, returning to Mazrui, in the making of a hero.
