Girl: That he could walk for a 100 miles on his belly— boy: That in the forest, he could laugh and no enemy would hear him. Girl: That he could mimic any noise of a bird and none could tell the difference.50 Dedan Kimathi: The Floating Signifier and the Missing Body i 331 in the above exchange, the authors turn to the romance of Kimathi to undo the colonial mythology, but they do so with the awareness that a countermyth, even a positive one, is also a myth. The role of the Woman in the play, then, is to relocate Kimathi from the realm of the mythical to that of the human: Woman: . . . He, Great commander that he was, Great organizer that he was, Great fearless fighter that he was, he was human! (al- most savagely, bitterly) Too human at times.51 Here, Kimathi’s greatness is underscored, but also qualified; he is repre- sented onstage as a hero, but not as a tragic hero.

To answer this question, we need to recall an argument made by Jean- Pierre Vernant in “The Tragic subject,” an influential study on the ori- gins of tragedy and tragic consciousness.
