22a, 23, and 24), is a person of more than average intelligence and a man wholly committed to a just cause, something that is echoed in Maina wa Kinyatti’s The Papers of Dedan Kimathi the veracity, provenance, access, and translation of which, in academic circles unfortu- nately, is still much in doubt.61 scattered throughout are gems of Gikuyu wisdom from a man moved to action, not out of flippant emotions but from the depths of the 298 i Nicholas Kariuki Githuku experience of colonial injustice and the pressing need for redress.62 one gleans appeals to the colonial authorities to rely less on coercion or fear and more on truth; appeals for mutual trust, respect, and friendship, and mutuality in giving and acceptance; appeals for truth and justice; appeals for shared prosperity while appreciating that all people cannot be rich; appeals for the need for reconciliation; and appeals for peace and mutual coexistence and the hope that blacks and whites in Kenya be of one heart. one also finds, in these few pages, a stunning tenacity in the justifiability of the cause for which he was fighting. The reading of the three Kimathi letters also shows a clear understanding of his cause: Kimathi and others were fighting for the country and its people, for wīathi (self-mastery) and for truth and justice. and, in this worthy struggle, surrender was out of the question.63 it was something that could not get into the minds of intelligent people. in- deed, it was preferable to sell one’s soul instead of having to surrender it. surrender would also not bring about an end to the war.64 it was also quite clear, in Kimathi’s mind, who Mau Mau were, and it was not just a matter of white and black as the problems that beset Kenya affected both races. as such, justice could not be expected from the barrel of the gun. Mau Mau was the cry of a people suffering from poverty and exploitation. it was a vehicle to liberate Kenya, to regain the Kenyan soil that europeans had occupied by force.
