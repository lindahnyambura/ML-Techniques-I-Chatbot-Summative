The shots appeared to come from the direction of the main road to which i had intended to go. after hearing the second shot i was running very fast along the trench to where i had been. it was beginning to get light – There was light – not full light. you could see across the valley distinctly. i did not see the person who fired the second or the third shot. i was still running very fast when i heard the third shot. it did not hit me. i was still in the trench. i got out of the trench on the reserve side. i saw down where there was a castor oil tree about ten yards away on the reserve side. There was a steep hill. i was sitting under the castor oil tree here. There was a slope down to the Thengeraini river. (Police Corporal put by accused in position he says he was sitting – squatting on hunkers knees about 21⁄2’ apart arms resting on knees and hands hanging forward. assessors see this demonstration.) When i saw a man coming from West to east – i was facing down towards the stream in the valley with my back to the trench. The tree was on my right but i was under it. The man came from in front of me slightly to the left. i had been sitting down under the tree for about twenty minutes. i had a watch with me and i looked at it. i had seen no other person that morning. after seeing him and noticing that he had a gun i raised my arms. i did not know who he was, but i noticed he was wearing a black overcoat and a whitish cap. i did not know to which group he belonged, but i thought he was one of those who kills others. i did not know whether he was a Mau Mau or Government. i raised my arms. i had a small stick me with – a staff. (accused corrects interpreter and says “staff.”)37 i dropped my staff and raised my arms and said: “it is i DeDan KiMaTHi. i have come to surrender. Don’t kill me. i have a pistol.” 37.
