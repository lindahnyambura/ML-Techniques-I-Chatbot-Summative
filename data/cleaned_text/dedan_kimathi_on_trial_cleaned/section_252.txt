Defense witnesses were therefore only very rarely called in special assize Court hearings, and when they did come to court it was usually only to provide a testimony as to the good character of the accused and not to speak to the facts of the case.19 These limitations might have been acceptable in a situation where the defense team had opportunities to discuss the case with the accused and at least give time to preparing a defense against the specific charges Mau Mau on Trial i 237 made. However, under the special assize Court regulations, notifications of hearings were given only a few days before trial, which allowed very little time for defendants to engage an advocate of their choice. no formal provision for the instruction of advocates was made in the police stations or Kikuyu Home Guard posts where suspects were often held, and many accused did not even meet their appointed advocates until hours before the trial. While some suspects were able to engage advocates through their relatives, this could only be done where the relatives were aware of the arrest and its circumstances. For the majority of those coming to trial, especially those captured as members of Mau Mau forest gangs, it was not a possibility. Though a handful of wealthier accused did manage to engage defense lawyers, notably in the lari trials, very few Kikuyu defendants came to court with an advocate of their own choosing.20 The often hasty scheduling of cases at the emergency assizes could also present difficulties for the prosecution in assembling a sufficiently ro- bust body of witnesses to give evidence. officers of the Crown were obliged to attend cases when summoned, even at short notice, and so for the most part pathologists, police officers, and even Home Guard and Tribal Police could be relied on to be present, although there were frequent difficulties with army officers, who might be on operations in a more distant location.
