oddly, when i last visited the site the nMK had allowed groups of war veterans to use other gazetted build- ings in the grounds for their meetings; at the time these focused in large part on plans for the first reparations claim. From our conversations at the site, these elders clearly thought the museum was to be devoted to Mau Mau and expressed hopes that tourist revenue would come their way.106 The museum is now open but contains very little apart from some antique chairs from the original court, a temporary pictorial exhibit from nairobi national Museum’s Kenya@50 exhibition (created to mark fifty years of independence), and, more controversially, a broken stone plaque commemorating “the Kikuyu guard and other security forces and all loyal subjects of the Queen who died in the fight against terrorism, 1951–57.”107 Though nMK staff now flatly deny this, back in 2009 the site was being touted as a future Mau Mau museum, and rumor had it that the british High Commission was planning to fund it.108 local staff told me at vari- ous times that they were just waiting for the nMK to send them Mau Mau artifacts from nairobi national Museum.109 but i knew the nMK was having enough problems filling the History of Kenya exhibition space, let alone finding enough material Mau Mau heritage to fill a whole museum.
