He had to ask himself if industrious african progress, unsupported by politi- cal pressure, would be enough to make the british listen. Given Kenya’s white supremacy and african anxieties, were either meritorious effort or sustained protest even imaginable? Kenyatta would need britain’s imperial support if the colonial gov- ernment were ever to reward black self-help, since that would be resisted by white settlers, whose profitable management of the war economy had consolidated their local power. This hope was not groundless. Kenyatta thought he had his precedent, the rifle fire of 1922 that he believed had shamed the imperial trustee of 1923. He also had friends in britain’s post- war labour government. so he asked his Kau meetings: were there twenty Kenyattas ready to die? Could they withstand the kicking of the imperial lion (or donkey) if he held its head? apparently without a nod to Thomas Jefferson, he told them that such martyr blood would nourish the tree of freedom; the british already had a guilty conscience.37 There is no evidence that he ever called for armed revolt; an unarmed crowd had provoked the guns of 1922—and, so he thought, imperial unease. Victim solidarity in the face of colonial provocation could work again. Kenyatta was not alone in this strategic hope. The luyia journalist Wycliffe awori deplored the lack of any popular protest when the leader of a dockworkers’ strike was sentenced to internal exile; if leaders were to take similar risks in the future “the common man” must become their “strong fortress.”38 but was a strong fortress possible at a time of social disquiet? Patri- otic men throughout east africa felt that their moral economies, moral ethnicities founded on domestic discipline, were under threat. big men, once supportive patrons of scarce labor on ample acres, were struggling to become capitalists in an era of rising population on limited land; their deserted clients despaired of marriage and self-mastery.
