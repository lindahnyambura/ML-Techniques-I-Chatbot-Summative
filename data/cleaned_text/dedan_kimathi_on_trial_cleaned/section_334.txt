Fur- thermore, this fragmentation of resistance lacked all vital centralization and a shared quantifiable strategic objective.52 as a result, while initially successful in tapping into the energy, general mood of dissent, and re- sources of a movement that had discrete but wide support of the majority of people in Central Kenya, solidaristic organization there and elsewhere in the colony and beyond did not quite take root. in spite of his prow- ess at drawing on global exemplars of revolution and political thought, Kimathi’s predicament was exacerbated by lack of success to connect with “generalized others” like such révolutionnaires elsewhere in the world and media organizations. in the long run, the colonial state caught up with this central figure whose personal resistance had become the keystone upon which the struggle to defeat tyranny, imperial hegemony, and regime of colonial “normalcy” or order rested. once the influence of the person at the center of the Mau Mau rebellion was snuffed out, the back of the re- sistance was broken.53 Thus ended the ambition of a man of courage and measured practical power to mold society to his purpose. but it is impor- tant to turn to the fulcrum on which this personal ambition and carefully cultivated identity turned: that is, various technologies of self-expression and, therefore, self-inscription and self-formation.
