My contention is that whatever story Kimathi might tell would take us no closer to understanding his life outside the mode of represen- tation established by the genre of Mau Mau memoirs.19 locating himself within the theater of Kenyan nationalism, Kimathi—a former actor and director—would probably cast himself as what György lukács famously described as the public character of modern drama, one in which “indi- vidual destinies” are represented in their exclusiveness so that they can give “direct expression to general destinies, destinies of whole nations, whole classes, indeed whole epochs.”20 rather than focus on his subjective identity, Kimathi would probably locate himself in the collective drama of his epoch and use his life story to recall the experiences of a generation in a period of transition. The story he would tell would probably stretch from the green fields of Karunaini and his education at the scottish mission at Tumutumu; the unhappy move to the settled territories; life in the nyandarua forest; the fateful day when a tribal policemen called ndirangu shot and wounded him; and his interrogation by the police and eventual trial at the High Court in nyeri. This could be Kimathi’s story in some ways, but it would remain within the symbolic order because it would rehearse the shared ex- periences of the so-called generation of the 1940s. in fact, it would be very Dedan Kimathi: The Floating Signifier and the Missing Body i 321 much like the story told by Waruhiu itote (General China) in “Mau Mau” General (1967), Kiboi Muriithi in War in the Forest (1971), J. Wamweya in Freedom Fighter (1971), and H. K. Wachanga in The Swords of Kirinyaga (1975). if it were textualized, Kimathi’s life story would have no identity or value outside the role assigned to him by a strange convergence of cul- tural forces—colonialism and the radical generation of the 1940s.
