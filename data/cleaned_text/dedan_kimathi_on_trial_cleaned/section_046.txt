While a defense of “insanity” was specifically not sought in this case, and indeed the evidence of epilepsy was presented not as explanation of Kimathi’s behavior or leadership but rather as explanation of his failure to articulate his desire to surrender at his capture, the specter of madness and witchcraft raised through this testimony certainly resonated with a much longer history of the pathologization of dissent.120 The testimony around Kimathi’s history with epilepsy also provides a stinging resonance with Maina wa Kinyatti’s vitriolic rant in 2007 during the unveiling of the Dedan Kimathi statue (photo 9), in which he argued that the fighters of the Mau Mau land and Freedom army were “still being treated like an epi- leptic orphan.”121 While not examined explicitly in this volume, Kimathi’s trial transcript opens up the possibility of new insights and explorations into african and european perceptions of health and disease, witchcraft and power, psychology and rebellion. For Kimathi, this trial, which would almost certainly end in his death, represented a last opportunity to record his patriotic vision and renegotiate the meaning of the Mau Mau movement. and yet, as a close reading of the trial and as the contributors to this volume suggest, mul- tiple meanings can be drawn from Kimathi’s testimony.122 as General Introduction: The Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 21 China wrote in his memoir regarding his own trial, “whether anyone tells the whole truth in a court which is trying him for his life is doubtful; at least, i doubt it.”123 after the assessors returned their unanimous verdict of guilty, Judge o’Connor sentenced Kimathi to death by hanging. Multiple appeals failed and Kimathi was moved to Kamiti Prison, in nairobi, where he was held until the day of his execution (see fig. a.5).
