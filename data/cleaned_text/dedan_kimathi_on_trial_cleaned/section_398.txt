This attack resulted in an estimated 150 fatalities, though the figure could well be much higher.32 lari was also a turning point for another reason: for the first time, as a result of the coverage and whispered dissemination of this awful news via the public grapevine, it was starkly apparent to Kenyans that Mau Mau had become a civil war. This unpalatable fact—which is still not accepted by everyone, including Mũgo and ngũgĩ and in the foreword to this volume, because it is regarded as continuing british propaganda—has complicated and destabilized “memories” and “forgetting” ever since.33 scholars, and Kenyans (both academic and nonacademic), have long argued and con- tinue to argue about who deserves commemoration. Just Mau Mau, or their opponents and victims, too?34 This discussion links to a wider debate, which involves ethnic communities outside the former Central Province claiming they also fought for freedom at various times. i shall discuss this below, in The amnesia years and later sections.35 Remembering Lari a selection of these photographs now adorns the walls of the lari Me- morial Peace Museum in Kimende, a grubby trading center on the main nairobi-to-nakuru highway just north of limuru. Their purpose these days, according to those running this tiny nonstate museum, is to remind visitors (largely local schoolchildren and other Kenyans—this is not on the tourist trail) of the internecine violence that tore this community apart, which must be “remembered” in order to avoid repetition. The museum was founded in 2001 as part of the Kenyan peace museums movement, ini- tiated in the late 1990s by then national Museums of Kenya (nMK) chief ethnographer sultan somjee.36 its management committee is made up of ex–Mau Mau and ex–Home Guard who collectively decided that some- thing should be done to heal the social wounds that had festered ever since 1953, and that the healing had to start with them.
