if so, would anyone 130 i Document 1 whose mental condition was clear and who had come in to surrender and had been shot in dastardly fashion while he was attempting to do so and who was then charged with having a firearm, not say: “but i was surrendering. i brought it in because i was surrendering. and that man had no right to shoot me”? Would he forget the surrendering part, do you think – the most important part – the whole point? is it credible? it is for you to consider. you may think he was unfit and not himself, mentally blurred. He says he was in pain and had noises in his ears and was feeling giddy. The doctor who examined him had passed him fit to be interviewed, but he may have been wrong. it is for you to consider. or you may think that what he was saying was that he didn’t know the law against carrying firearms and that this surrender idea is an afterthought. senior superintendent baKer produced some surrender leaflets. There are two lots of surrender leaflets: (i) issued 24/8/53. That says “Come in and surrender without delay”. but that still stands. it also says: “if possible come with your arms”. (ii) 2nd lot issued 18/1/55 “Govt. Will not kill you for carrying arms”. There was another addressed to gang leaders dated 24/8/53 which says: “you cannot get into any danger when you come to negotiate your surrender with that of your whole gang and your arms. Come out during the day time waving green branches this will ensure that you are not shot at”. That says surrender now carrying a green branch and bring in your arms. That has been withdrawn. it was withdrawn in July 1955. so the only leaflet that could be “lawful excuse” in october 1956 for carrying arms would be the one of august 1953 ones. but the later one might be a “lawful excuse” if he didn’t know it had been withdrawn. Do you believe accused was surrendering?
