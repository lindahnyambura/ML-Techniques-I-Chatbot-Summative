in his judgment, however, the Chief Justice dealt with the point as follows – “i also directed the assessors (and i direct myself) that it would not afford a lawful excuse for one terrorist to carry a pistol and ammunition for the purpose of protecting himself from other terrorists whom he might offended.” it is submitted that the reasons alleged by your Petitioner for carrying a revolver and ammunition could have constituted a lawful excuse and that, by his said directions, the Chief Justice withdrew from the consideration of the Court a defence which was open to your Petitioner. 7. THaT the learned Chief Justice directed the assessors as to your Petitioner’s defence that he intended to bring the pistol and ammunition in for the purpose of surrendering them to the proper authorities, and therefore had a “lawful excuse” within the meaning of the regulation, as follows :- “i direct you as a matter of law that if the accused’s story is true and he was intending to bring this pistol and ammunition in in order to surrender them to the proper authorities and he had done overt acts in pursuance of that intention, that could in law be a lawful excuse which would entitle him to be acquitted.” similarly in his judgment the Chief Justice stated as follows :- “i directed the assessors, and i direct myself, that if the story of the accused is true and he was intending to bring in the pistol and the ammunition in order to surrender them to the proper authorities in response to an invita- tion in a Government leaflet and had done overt acts in pursuance of that intention, that could, in law constitute a lawful excuse which would entitled him to be acquit- ted.” your Petitioner submits that the said directions are wrong in that they suggest that in the absence of proof of specific overt acts this defence could not succeed.
