The Tribal Police were a parallel police force that answered to the pro- vincial administrations rather than to the Kenya police. The Home Guard, a body formed during the emergency out of militia groups from the civil- ian population and armed by the colonial state, were specifically tasked with policing the reserves and given legal status as a “special Tribal Police,” which gave them enhanced powers of arrest and the right to shoot in defined, prohib- ited “no-go” areas. For more, see branch, Defeating Mau Mau. 11. as part of the counterinsurgency, british officials used forced labor from the villages in central Kenya to dig trenches, or ditches, along forest areas in an attempt to prevent movement of people and supplies between the “native reserves” and the forests. These trenches acted as a prohibited area, a “no-go” zone that provided a space for patrols and increased powers to arrest or shoot on sight. Karatina university, in conjunction with the national Museums of Kenya and the british institute in eastern africa, has been working toward excavating, rehabilitating, and restoring some of these “Mau Mau trenches” around Mount Kenya. For the approximate location of the trenches in ques- tion, see map 2 of Central Kenya in this volume.
