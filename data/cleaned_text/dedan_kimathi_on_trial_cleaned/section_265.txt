statements of this kind were taken from all suspects soon after their capture, in preparation for the court hear- ing. The typed document presented to the court and headed “statement of the accused” was not a verbatim account of the interview but rather a reconstruction from the notes taken by the police officer during the in- terrogation. The process of “reconstruction” inevitably gave scope for the interrogator to impose specific interpretations and nuances on the words of the accused, ironing out inconsistencies, and perhaps even omitting 246 i David M. Anderson details that were considered either irrelevant or unhelpful to the prosecution. Kimathi’s pretrial statement, like all others by accused persons brought before the emergency assize courts, must therefore be treated with the greatest of caution. The defense that Miller developed in court on Kimathi’s behalf chal- lenged the pretrial statement in many details but hinged on two key is- sues: first, that because of his long-standing condition of epilepsy,45 the statement Kimathi made to police officers when he was recovering from the effects of anesthetic following his operation should not be accepted by the court. The condition, it was claimed, had caused the accused to be confused and unclear in his responses. on this point, it appears that Miller’s purpose was to have the statement made to the police on 22 octo- ber discounted principally because it contained within it comments that amounted to a confession: Kimathi admitted that he not only held the re- volver with which he was arrested but also a shotgun. Proof of possession of arms was sufficient for the death sentence to be passed, and Kimathi’s statement therefore amounted to a clear admission of guilt. However, the issue of epilepsy also touched on the question of Kimathi’s acknowledged volatile behavior and might therefore also be construed, in part at least, as a plea in mitigation.
