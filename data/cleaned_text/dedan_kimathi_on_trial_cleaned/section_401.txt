a generous interpretation of the amnesia policy is that Kenyatta sought to unite the nation, inspire in citizens a sense of multiethnic na- tionhood, appease european settlers, and heal rifts in his own Gikuyu community. “Kenyatta had to say this  chiefly for po- litical reasons, and especially because the existence of a people or group that fought and suffered more for independence than anybody else is incompatible with the myth of Kenyan unity.”47 it was also a means of fending off veterans’ unrealistic demands for compensation, free land, and jobs, and avoiding the expense of erecting public memorials to lib- eration “heroes.” it was not until 2006–7 that the government of then president Mwai Kibaki embarked on a mausoleum-building spree, the latest chapter of which is a mausoleum for Kapenguria six member Fred Kubai, completed in July 2015.48 Kershaw explains “forgetting” very differently, in Gikuyu cultural terms: “The independent government’s attempt to wipe  out of history was a proper Kikuyu response to a painful event,” on a par with famine and other disasters that should not be referred to again.49 alter- natively, it may be argued the new president sought to obscure the fact that he had never been a member of Mau Mau, let alone lost blood in the forests.
