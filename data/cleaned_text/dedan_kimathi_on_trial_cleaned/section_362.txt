some leading radical intellectuals, freedom fighters, and patriots in their own right do not consider this necessary, as it would serve to dignify and legitimize colonial law and “justice” and, indeed, the whole colonial enterprise that has, as Mĩcere Gĩthae Mũgo points out, come under searing criticism by, among others, aimé Césaire in Discourse on Colonialism, trans. Joan Pinkham (new york: Monthly review Press, 2001). With reference to my email ex- changes (between 7 and 28 March 2016) with Mĩcere Gĩthae Mũgo, Maina Kinyatti, and Willy Mutunga, it is likely that the release of Kimathi’s trial docu- ments and this volume to coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of Kimathi’s execution will witness even more radical demands including, in Mũgo’s words: that the current british and Kenyan governments categorically denounce and dissociate themselves from a historical crime—specifically, the conviction and murder of Kimathi. additionally, within this particular context, that a fresh official public apology be made to Kimathi’s family, Kenya land and Free- dom army ex-combatants, and the Kenyan people by both governments for condoning the crime over historical time by failing to officially condemn it; that both governments (definitely that of Kenya) reaffirm Kimathi as a Kenyan hero extraordinaire and think of an appropriate special medal to award him posthumously; and that, in consultation and collaboration with the family, Kimathi’s remains be located, exhumed, and given a special public and hero’s national burial. according to Mũgo, “an apology should be made to the fam- ily for the length of time it has taken to do this despite public requests and . . . many appeals by DK’s family.” 86. emerson, “on Courage,” in Works. 87. see “Final letter from Kimathi to Father Marino,” 17 February 1957, transcribed as Document 15 in this volume. 88.
