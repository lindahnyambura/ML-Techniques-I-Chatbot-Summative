The KG were more loyal to economic self-mastery than to alien rule but saw the british as more protective than Mau Mau of this civic virtue. The names Gikuyu themselves adopted can be understood in that sense. insurgents were itun- gati, senior but still unmarried warriors who served as Kenyatta’s rear- guard, his “strong fortress,” as their grandfathers had protected cattle raids on their return journey. The KG were kamatimu, spear-carrying junior elders, entitled to marry after completing their warrior duty.66 itungati fought, therefore, to reopen a path to adulthood, kamatimu to discipline juniors. some thought Mau Mau were irungu, a candidate generation ex- pected to “straighten” society, as Kimathi desired and kirore had intended in the 1930s. others called the emergency Maina’s war, the battle of a gen- eration who would already have been in power, no longer irungu, had the practice of generational transition not fallen away under colonial rule.67 itungati and kamatimu shared, then, a philosophy of history; more im- mediately, some also held material interests in common. a striking example of shared interests linked Kimathi, notorious “ter- rorist,” and senior chief Muhoya, a leading “loyalist.” Their home area, north Tetu, in nyeri District, had experienced a particularly divisive struggle for rural capitalism, known officially as progressive farming. in the 1940s an emerging gentry converted their lineage seniority into regis- tered property, at the expense of the usage rights they owed to juniors and clients. a KCa man in his youth, Muhoya was a pioneer in this revolution Mau Mau’s Debates on Trial i 271 in moral economy, blandly called land reform. He led in the private fenc- ing of pasture for the grade cattle (crossbreeds between indigenous and imported european cattle) he and others bought from white neighbors.
