it is submitted that proof of the invitation contained in the 164 i Document 4 Government’s surrender leaflets together with your Petitioner’s sworn evidence that the said invitation was the reason for his forming the intention to come in and surrender with his arms was sufficient in all the circumstances, if such evidence was believed, to provide a lawful excuse. 8. THaT the learned Chief Justice directed the assessors with regard to the two lots of surrender leaflets as follows – “There are two lots of surrender leaflets: (i) issued 24/8/53. That says “Come in and surrender without delay”. but that still stands. it also says: “if possible come with your arms.” (ii) 2nd lot issued 18/1/55 “Govt. Will not kill you for carrying arms”. There was another addressed to gang leaders dated 24/8/53 which says: “you cannot get into any danger when you come to negotiate your surrender with that of your whole gang and your arms. Come out during the day time waving green branches this will ensure that you are not shot at”. That says surrender now carrying a green branch and bring in your arms. That has been withdrawn. it was with- drawn in July 1955. “so the only leaflet that could be ‘lawful excuse’ in octo- ber 1956 for carrying arms would be the one of august 1953 ones. but the later one might be a ‘lawful excuse’ if he didn’t know it had been withdrawn.” in his Judgment the Chief Justice mentioned the same point and stated that of the two lots of surrender leaflets “the second was withdrawn in July 1955. The first still stands”. your Petitioner submits that this is a misdirection and that it is irrelevant that the later leaflet was withdrawn in July 1955 provided that your Petitioner was coming in to surrender. He therefore submits that the defence of “lawful excuse” would have been open to him even if there had never been any surrender leaflet. 9.
