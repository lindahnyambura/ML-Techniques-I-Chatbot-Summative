nationalists like Kariuki, who are eager to sustain Kimathi’s memory, can only do so by recalling, not his heroism, but his arrest and subsequent hanging, now cast in what nicole loraux might call “a ceaseless song of lamentation, more specifically a song of lament.”26 at the lodwar detention camp, news of Kimathi’s arrest is met with a deep sense of loss: The detainees “mourned in silence, and those who could find a piece of cloth from old puttees, wore it on their shoulders in their grief, “Kariuki recalls.27 From this moment onward Kariuki undertakes the task of turning Kimathi into a figure of mourning and commemoration: Dedan Kimathi was a brave and valiant fighter for freedom and a great leader of his people in the forest. . . . i have been told by a student who was once taught by him that he was at that time a very gentle, kindly man. in the forest his courage was legendary and my people are al- ready talking of putting up a statue of him in nairobi. some of them refuse to believe even today that the Kenya Government hanged him: they still think he is alive. His wife, Mukami, and their children, suf- fered greatly in nyeri after his execution, and i have done all i can to help the family since my release. The new Government must assist such people and all the others orphaned in the struggle.28 significantly, the work of commemoration—which will later cost Kariuki his own life—is intimately tied to the fortunes or misfortunes of national- ist desire in its moment of dissipation. To put it another way, the figure of Kimathi will circulate in the popular imagination, but it will be wrenched 324 i Simon Gikandi away from commemorative historiography, turning the Mau Mau leader into “an imaginary without an image.”29 Tragedy and the Figure of Mourning This situation will change dramatically in 1974 when Kenneth Watene publishes Dedan Kimathi, a tragic drama whose motivations, intention, and value remain puzzling and controversial.
