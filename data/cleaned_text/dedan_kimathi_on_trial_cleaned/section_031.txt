Directly following the declaration of the emergency, the colonial government launched a series of operations aimed at imprisoning political leaders, rounding up Gikuyu residents of nairobi, and interning in concentration camps both those suspected of Mau Mau involvement and those in the rural areas accused of providing “passive” support to the movement.53 in november 1952, Kimathi found himself ar- rested for the first time during one of the frequent “screenings” of farm laborers, on suspicions of his involvement in the murder of senior Chief nderi. but Kimathi managed to escape by bribing a local warder (perhaps with the assent of local chief Muhoya, whose relationship with Kimathi is discussed below). Kimathi then headed for the nyandarua forest, also known as the aberdare forest. it was in the nyandarua forest that Kimathi rose to become one of the most important leaders of the Mau Mau rebellion. His time in the forest is the best-documented, though still greatly contested, period in his life. There he founded the Kenya Defence Council and the Kenya Parliament, both attempts to bring order, hierarchy, and centralization to the scattered Mau Mau forces.
