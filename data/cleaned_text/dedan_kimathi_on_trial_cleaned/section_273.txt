evidence on all of this might have been revealed had Henderson been summoned as a witness, but given the character of the charges against Kimathi—the possession of arms and ammunition—there was no need to air details of security operations in the courtroom in order to secure a conviction. Far from interpreting the trial papers as indicating Kimathi had “given up” on the insurrection, and was ready to submit himself to the british through surrender, a wider reading of the historical context there- fore suggests that his nationalist fervor was as strong as ever on the day of his capture. Kimathi’s wider motives, behavior, and intentions as a rebel leader, and the broader context of his situation in the nyandarua forest, all mat- ter greatly because it affects how Kimathi is to be judged not by a colonial court but by history. For Kenya’s nationalists, the trial itself brings revela- tions about Kimathi’s willingness to surrender at an earlier stage of the insurrection, and about the deep and painful divisions between Mau Mau fighters in the forests. How should these disputes be judged? Can they be 252 i David M. Anderson reconciled within a nationalist history that holds Kimathi as a national hero? There is certainly much more history yet to be written on these mat- ters, not least on the place of surrenders and amnesty in the history of the Mau Mau rebellion, and on the cohesion and leadership of the Mau Mau forces in the forests of Mount Kenya and the nyandarua. ali Mazrui’s per- ceptive essay on heroism and Kenya’s history, written in 1963, suggested that Kenyans would need to adopt a “selective memory” if they were to find national heroes for their newly independent nation. “Kenya’s candi- dates are the returning rebels from the aberdares,” wrote Mazrui.
