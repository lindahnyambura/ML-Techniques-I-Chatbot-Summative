is the photographic pose a projection of the self into public space or a form of concealment? Can we ever know who the real Kimathi is? 320 i Simon Gikandi Here, it would be useful to recall that part of Kimathi’s attraction to writers ranging from Henderson in 1958 to sam Kahiga in the 1990s is the idea that he is an unknowable person. For Henderson and his policemen, the thrill of the hunt for Kimathi is that their quarry is “as elusive as a butterfly.”16 at the end of Kahiga’s novel, The Real Dedan Kimathi, Major Theuri, one of Kimathi’s aides, comes to realize that although he has spent many years close to the field marshal “and considered himself as one of the very few people who knew the real Kimathi, he knew nothing of the man.”17 Most attempts to write about Kimathi begin with an acknowledg- ment of the limits of the work of representation itself, a concession that in spite of the extensive archive he has left behind, the marshal remains unknown and unknowable. The corporeal absence of Kimathi—his death and missing body—made the task of representation even more daunting. if only Kimathi were alive today to tell his own story, says General China in “Mau Mau” General, “we would all be the wiser for it.”18 but this wish begs two questions: What kind of story would Kimathi tell? and would this story lead us to a better understanding of his compli- cated life?
