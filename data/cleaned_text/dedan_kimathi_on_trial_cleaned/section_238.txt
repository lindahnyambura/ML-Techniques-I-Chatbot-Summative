you better trust in me a hundred times more than your present home-guards who have no trust in your struggling Government. once i shout peace, there is never a war in Kenya. but, my dear, how can a rat come out of the pit while the cat watches to catch it? 105. exhibit no. 23, Criminal Case no. 46 of 1956, Dedan Kimathi v. re- gina, Her Majesty’s supreme Court of Kenya at nyeri, Kimathi File, archives of the supreme Court of Kenya. 106. oliver lyttelton, secretary of state for the Colonies, 1951–54. Michael blundell, Kenyan farmer and politician—legislative Council Member (1948– 63) and Minister on the emergency War Committee (1954–55). 207 regard us as humanly and the whole will get settled within a week. refuse us and the world will turn against you soon. i am a better citizen, seeking peace for Kenya but if it be that the Kenya Government is just a dry weather that nothing of so called peace will peacefully germinate i will leave such a desert to be manured by one of the big four or three with its auxiliaries whenever desired. surely i pity the british empire, so strong, so rich, so clever, so wise and well unified whilst being led astray by beast like leaders who are surely an anthrax to both cow and the calf. british law became temporary, no Christianity but greediness. see now, this is Kenya, uganda, Tanganyika, rhodesial {sic}, bechuanaland, sudan, nagiria {sic}, egypt, british Guiana, Jamaica, Korea, spain, Tunisia, Moroco {sic}, indo-China and indonesia and the rest weak nations who you laugh at. What are they sounding? Do not you pity the british isle in time of atomic? i prophesy that so the african continent is known as dark continent the first, british isle will be the last dark island however strong you are. because you never pity even a widow nor even a child who God himself has created. your Great City is fallen down. your trade communications are cut up. your empire is sold to another nation, your wealth is deprived.
