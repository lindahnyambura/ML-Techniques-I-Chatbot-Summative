again, others have told the emergency’s history; it need not be repeated here.60 Moreover, after nearly four years of warfare Kimathi said nothing in court about the fighting; his defense lay in the bitterness of debate within Mau Mau, “a polity defined by dissent.”61 While the context was unprecedented in its brutality, the terms of debate were neither new nor revolutionary; they continued to reflect the dual experience of subjection to a global em- pire while also learning world history. Gikuyu-language portions of the bible first appeared in 1903, the complete new Testament in 1926, and the old in 1951,62 so Kimathi the “reader” was well aware of his global environ- ment. His letter of october 1954 not only compared Mau Mau with other contemporary conflicts but also situated Gikuyu in history. The children of israel, the world’s prototype nation, were his model.63 This global com- parison under the eye of history continued to point, as in the 1920s, to the 270 i John M. Lonsdale need for a domestic “code of behaviour,” especially if future generations were to be as self-disciplined as their elders. The arguments that Kimathi put on trial were entirely conventional. That is why they destroyed Mau Mau’s cohesion from within as surely as did counterinsurgent warfare from without. since Gikuyu shared a sense of social breakdown, decisions to join one side or another of the Mau Mau war depended, as stated, on the shock of events. The most devastating was the mass reflux of squatter families from the White Highlands to their former, now crowded, homes.64 This remigration—at once a labor protest, an official policy, and the outcome of white farmer fears—inflamed intimately poisonous land disputes between Gikuyu and supplied recruits for militant leaders. in a parallel process of- ficials prodded the knots of “resistance” clustered around colonial chiefs into self-defense units that became the “loyalist” Kikuyu Guard (KG).65 loyalist is as contentious a name as Mau Mau.
