The one Kenyan african lawyer practicing in nairobi at this time, Chiedo argwings-Kodhek, worked on little else but Mau Mau cases throughout the emergency and was harried and harassed by european administra- tors and police officers because they suspected him of harboring Mau Mau sympathies.22 as a consequence of these arrangements, the proceedings of the special emergency assizes therefore invariably had a racial com- plexion: european judges presided, with european lawyers for the state mounting the prosecution, while asian lawyers predominated for the de- fense, and africans stood accused in the dock. The regulations governing the special emergency assizes also al- lowed for mass trials. approximately 70 percent of the cases heard be- tween 1953 and 1956 involved multiple accused—usually between two and five codefendants standing together in the dock—but in the largest trials, deriving from the lari massacre, more than fifty accused were arraigned in a single case. Mass trials of this kind tended to come in relation to the more infamous cases, such as the murders of europeans, large-scale mas- sacres of african loyalists, or the capture of large gangs of Mau Mau. Mul- tiple defendants appearing together raised greater dangers of a miscarriage of justice, with the individual pleadings and evidence of each defendant sometimes being lost in the generalities of the case, especially when the trial was in the hands of inexperienced acting judges—a fact remarked upon at length by the appeals court whenever the opportunity arose.23 all special emergency assize trials were heard before a single judge, without the assistance of a jury. Trial by jury in Kenya for any criminal case had always been an entitlement for europeans but was not extended to africans accused even in supreme Court hearings. The decision to deploy a single judge in the emergency assizes, rather than a panel of three, was done entirely for reasons of expediency.
