if the mandate of decolonization is that the Mau Mau movement be suppressed and forgotten so that the narrative of decolonization can be rewritten, the figure of Kimathi somehow resists repression and seems to sit outside the national doctrine of “forgive and forget.”2 i therefore propose that Kimathi is neither the demonic figure of colo- nial discourse, nor the heroic subject of radical nationalism, but what the anthropologist Claude lévi-strauss famously called a “floating signifier,” 317 a term intended “to represent an undetermined quantity of signification,” but is in “itself void of meaning and thus apt to receive any meaning.”3 Kimathi is a signifier with a value, but what this value represents is vari- able and open to multiple interpretations. i work under the influence of the poststructuralist lesson that there is no Kimathi except in the way he has been imagined and represented—to borrow a term from Jacques Derrida—sous rature, under erasure.4 My search here is not for the real Kimathi but for the symbolic and the imaginary figure that both informs and haunts the national narrative from his grave.5 i offer two readings of Kimathi: the symbolic figure that emerges out of the archive and the one imagined by creative writers. somewhere in the cracks left by these two forms of discourses—the archival and the imaginative—we might recover Kimathi’s quantity of signification and perhaps begin to understand what value he holds in debates about Kenyan pasts and presents. Kimathi in the Symbolic Order Jacques lacan teaches us that the symbolic is a product of language and narrative.
