Thiong’o and Mũgo turn to theater as a medium of imaginative reconstruction of the past to inform and educate people about the existence of erstwhile colonial overlords disguised as “na- tionalists.” Moreover, these writers transform the sphere of perfor- mance into a site of investigation of communal memory in order to reinstate the impeccable nature of the collective ethos of africans. The end result is performative history: the performance of the play functions as a register of social memory through the deliberate (re)connection with the struggle of the 1950s. This play disinters and resurrects Dedan Kimathi as a revolutionary hero. it also powerfully and effectively portrays the injustices endured by ordinary Kenyans during the tumultuous decade of the 1950s.76 indeed, more than imaginatively recreating the past—and in so doing, re- flecting the collective will of Kenyan peasants and workers in their refusal to succumb to over sixty years of colonial torture and ruthless oppres- sion—this play was written to give people courage and to urge them to an even higher level of resolve in their struggle for total liberation.77 ngũgĩ and Mũgo understood this work to be a continuation of the repertoire of political dissent epitomized by Kimathi as the embodiment of the coun- try’s anticolonial struggle. both writers can, therefore, be seen as intel- lectual Mau Maus in this long lineage of dissent paying homage to the paragon of radical decolonization. likewise, Dan “Chizi” aceda, a socially conscious musician, in his song “Guns and arrows,” from his 2010 breakout sophomore album, 302 i Nicholas Kariuki Githuku Benganology, manages to evoke, indeed disinter, not only Dedan Kimathi but also Mekatilili wa Menza, a heroine of the early struggle against british imperialism in 1913 and 1914. in light of all that has gone wrong in the post- colony, Kimathi and Mekatilili, he sings, must be turning in their graves.
