The princess was regaled with stories of his capture, even meeting with the tribal police officers that led the capture outside of Government House.106 broadcast around the world, Kimathi’s capture brought the special-forces operations in Kenya to a “spectacular conclusion.”107 The trial would occur almost a month later and last eight days. it would be one of the last in the long parade of Mau Mau trials through- out the 1950s that would lead 1,090 africans to their deaths by hanging and thousands more to detention camps.108 The charges against Kimathi were unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of am- munition.109 originally, british officials also charged Kimathi with the murder of Mwai itufanwa, a forest guard who served outside aberdare national Park, near nyeri, and was killed in December 1952.110 but murder was a much harder charge to prove, and the mere possession of the pistol, a charge never denied by Kimathi, carried the death penalty under the emergency regulations. The murder charge was thus “delayed,” though according to Prosecutor D. W. Conroy, it was technically never dropped.111 outside the courthouse, hundreds would gather each day hoping to catch a glimpse of the rebel leader, carried in and out of the court on a stretcher, still suffering from the bullet wound to his upper thigh (photo 6). Crowds grew to the point that local police set up roadblocks leading into the town.112 among those in the crowd was Kimathi’s mother, who would also testify in the trial. Time magazine would describe the scene with vivid, and highly prejudicial, imagery: Introduction: The Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 19 Day after day, in the shade of the great jacaranda tree outside the courthouse at nyeri, an old woman squatted, moodily scratching the vermin beneath her filthy rags.
