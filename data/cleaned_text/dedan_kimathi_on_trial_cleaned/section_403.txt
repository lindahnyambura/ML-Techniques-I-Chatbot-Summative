He later wrote that “Mau Mau was a disease which had been eradicated, and must never be remembered again,” repeating what he had said at Githunguri in 1962 just after being released from detention.56 on Kenyatta Day in 1964, he told the crowds Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 347 “the foundations of our future must lie in the theme: Forgive and forget. There is no point then, and there is still less purpose today, in dwelling on the past, in stoking fires of revenge or animosity.”57 “Forgive and forget” became another key mantra, along with “Harambee!” (let’s pull together). The emphasis was now on hard work: Kenyans were sharply told not to ex- pect free things, such as handouts of land to veterans.
