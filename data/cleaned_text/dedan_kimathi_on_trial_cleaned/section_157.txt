ndirangu denied that. ndirangu has been given a reward for the capture of Kimathi. you must consider whether you think that that has anything to do with the evidence he has given. Defence suggests that it has. Crown do not admit that. He got his reward before he gave evidence in this court and after he had given his statement to the police. nJoGi s/o nGaTia. Tribal Police reserve Constable. saturday 20/10/56 he went out in a party commanded by sgt. Mwangi. They reached the forest and were posted in twos. njogi was with ndirangu. They stayed there all night. about day break they moved. ndirangu saw something and pointed it out. Witness then saw something which looked like a stump on the forest side of the trench about two paces from the top. it wasn’t easy to see clearly. it moved. ndirangu then shouted. The man jumped down and ran away along the ditch. He had been carrying something which looked 124 i Document 1 like poles on his shoulder and dropped it when ndirangu shouted. ndirangu shouted: “stop” and fired. They ran after the man. Witness fired. The man tried to climb the bank on the forest side. ndirangu fired again. Witness fired twice into the air, so he says. if ndirangu fired three times and njogi fired twice that would make five shots in all. but no one else seems to have heard more than three. you may think that this young man njogi is trying to make out that he took a more important part than he did. you may have your doubts whether he fired at all. The man tried to go across and ndirangu fired another shot i.e. ndirangu’s third shot. This witness first said that the man was in the trench when ndirangu fired his third shot. afterwards he corrected that and said that he had not seen the third shot fired as there were some intervening bushes and he had not seen the man hit. Maina and Mwangi Kanguru came up and they searched for about one hour. They said: “surrender”. but got no answer. another witness said that they did not call out.
