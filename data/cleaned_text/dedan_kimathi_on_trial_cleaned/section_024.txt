Kariuki, the populist leader assassinated in 1975, requesting the Kimathi file from the High Court of Kenya for a book he planned to write in 1971.37 The request was denied. My own search for the trial began inconspicuously enough.38 after working on the court transcript of another anticolonial rebel, Dini ya Msambwa leader elijah Masinde, whose trial had been mislabeled in the archives and never before used by historians, i decided, back in 2008, to 6 i Julie MacArthur venture into the High Court of Kenya (now the supreme Court) in search of Kimathi’s trial.39 i had heard from colleagues David anderson and stacey Hynd that the trial was housed there, and that a few had caught glimpses of various versions of the document, but that no one had as yet been able to secure a complete, certified copy. i arrived at the court and was escorted to the head archivist, who instructed me to bring a letter on my university’s letterhead—the university of Cambridge at the time—with my request to view the file. letter in hand, i returned and was told to meet another ar- chivist in the basement where the court archives were held. navigating the winding basement corridors stacked high with files and trial transcripts from floor to ceiling, i eventually found a young archivist who took my letter, told me to return the following day, and disappeared. The next day i arrived at the courthouse to find a stack of papers containing what appeared to be the trial of Dedan Kimathi lying on a crowded table. The file was remarkable, containing a fuller picture of the trial than had ever been revealed before. i copied the entirety of the file and excit- edly began research into this fascinating historical document. as i began to consult fellow scholars and legal experts, however, doubt was cast on the authenticity of this file. it was filled with strange artifacts.
