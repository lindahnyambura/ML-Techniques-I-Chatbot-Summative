Conceived within the intelligible rules and constraints of lan- guage, a symbolic representation is premised on an acceptance of the rules of the Father, the rules that control desire and communication: “it is in the name of the father that we must recognize the support of the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified his person with the figure of the law.”6 Moreover, the symbolic function is what allows a subject to enter into the community of others—it is “the pact which links . . . subjects together in one action. The human action par excellence is originally founded on the existence of the world of the symbol, namely on laws and contracts.”7 Colonial discourse, for example, is keen to exclude Kimathi from the world of the Father (the law) and to delink him from the community that he claims to represent. The key lexicon in ian Henderson’s narrative of Kimathi is illegitimacy, devia- tion, and “a reputation for delinquency.”8 Conversely, the task of rewrit- ing Kimathi as a nationalist hero depends on his insertion into a world of collective symbols and communal references intended to keep his spirit alive as part of the “continuing struggle of our people for democracy and social justice.”9 318 i Simon Gikandi There is no doubt that the Kimathi who emerges in retrospective accounts such as Karari njama’s Mau Mau from Within (1970), or in Kimathi’s letters and speeches, is keenly attuned to his role in a commu- nity of symbols carefully cultivated through speech acts. in reference to the killing of some teachers by his forces, for example, Kimathi, who is an ardent advocate of education, speaks as the voice of a universal truth. He assumes that his listeners—and the people in general—share his views and that there is a concurrence between the speaker and his real and implied audience: “of all the teachers who have been killed and schools which have been destroyed, very few  orders from me; in fact, none for the killing of teachers.
