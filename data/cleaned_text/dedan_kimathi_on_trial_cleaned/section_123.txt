That was in the second month of 1954. – that was the second dispute. That is when i finally split from the others. My hideout was a long way in the forest. Q. since that day, have you carried out any anti-british or anti- Government activity? a. no – and not even previous to that. nor have my five compan- ions. Q. This pistol which was found in your possession. Tell the Court where it came from. a. This pistol was handed to me on the 2/4/55 by MaCHaria KiManya to defend myself against those who wished to kill me, that is forest men. i don’t mean security Forces in the forest. i mean Mau Mau. i had a pistol only for the pur- pose of defending myself against Mau Mau and no others. MaCHaria KiManya told me when he gave me the pistol that the enmity has grown enormous between us and those who objected to the letter which i wrote to the Govt. {sic} the first letter. There was no other reason but that i should defend myself from those people. i also got six rounds of ammunition from MaCHaria which are the same six rounds as were found in my possession on 21st october. i have never used that pistol or any other. since the second month of 1954 i have been alone in the forest living with those five companions. i have seen the surrender notice. it says that people who surrender should not leave behind the arms in his possession. eXHibiT C put to me. i have seen this notice calling on persons to surrender. Q. Does it say this? “if possible, come with your arms.” i brought my pistol because i followed the instructions in Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 91 eXHibiT C. i left my companions in the forest in February, 1954. i was arrested in october, 1956. Q. That was a long time and your life was in danger. Why didn’t you come down before? a. because there was sHs: 10,000 reward. i knew that if i came out either police or home guards would kill me in order to get paid. also, i have been writing frequently to him  the Government because i knew that if i came out to them i should be shot.
