indeed, independence was one way of preventing this possibility: it was a safety valve that ensured that the madding crowd of have-nots could not at any time leap over the barriers and invade the pitch of sanitized politics of “law and order,” as they had in 1952. in death as in life, Kimathi represents the deep politics of moral ethnicity that continues to pit the haves and the have-nots that is, at once, a dynastic, factional, and generational game.75 This, then, is what explains why he continues to be the revolutionary touchstone by which radical politicians such as J. M. Kariuki, writers acutely sensitive to social and political forces and relations of production, and socially conscious musicians, evaluate politics in Kenya. Kimathi remains, perhaps more than any other public figure in Kenya’s history, the focal point of nation- alism, the smoldering embers of which promise to glow brighter into an ever-shining dawn of the quest for popular statehood. it is impor- tant, therefore, to reflect, in closing, on how he has been valorized and disinterred in popular culture, the official silence of over half a century notwithstanding. The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 301 A Paragon of Radical Decolonization, Touchstone of Nationalism, and Subterranean Politics Disinterred Written in the early 1970s, The Trial of Dedan Kimathi, a play by ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o and Mĩcere Gĩthae Mũgo, was the first to recognize and give all due prominence to the role that Kimathi played in the struggle for inde- pendence. i have discussed this elsewhere: Thiong’o and Mũgo set out to write a revisionist play celebrating Mau Mau freedom fighters and, in so doing, admittedly, remake Kenya’s history. indeed, it was a deliberate attempt to excavate and expunge the ignominious, criminal depiction, trial and execution of Dedan Kimathi, and other freedom fighters, under an unjust and crimi- nal colonial law.
