6 was in good condition and an accurate pistol and could have killed a human being if it had hit him in a vital spot. spent bullet retrieved by Vidler and produced. a.s.P. Vidler corroborates inspector blaCKMan as to the test carried out by them of the pistol and the ammunition alleged to have been found on the accused. This witness had been in the Metropolitan Police and the Kenya Police for over 22 years and in the royal navy for three years. This witness has had training in the use of pistols, is armed with a .38 revolver himself. says that this pistol was in good working order except for a loose trigger guard, was capable of causing death and is “a lethal barrelled weapon”. if you believe that evidence you may think that the 2nd point i mentioned is established and that that revolver is a “firearm” within the meaning of the regulation. noW as To THe FirsT PoinT: (1) Did the accused have this revolver in his possession? The accused does not dispute that he did. He says he had it; but he was coming in to surrender and bringing his arms in accordance with the instructions in the surrender leaflet. That is the real issue in the case – Was he surrendering or not? but, in as much as the prosecution have to prove possession and the circumstances in which the accused was found in possession are relevant not only on that but on the question of surrender or not. i will review the prosecution evidence for you. CounT 2. The evidence on count 1 is as i have said largely the same as the evidence on Count 2 because the prosecution allege (and Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 121 the accused admits) that the ammunition which is the subject of Count 2 was in the pistol which is the subject of Count 1, and that the accused knew that. so if he possessed one, you may think that he also possessed the other.
