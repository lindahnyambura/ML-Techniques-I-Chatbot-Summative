There is a Kimathi estate in nairobi with its own Kimathi primary school. There are Kimathi memorial secondary schools in various parts of nyeri County. Karunaini, Kimathi’s birthplace, is in a Kimathi sublocation. and in the 1970s, during a frenzy of institu- tion building, the nyeri elite, led by Mwai Kibaki, set up an institute of Technology named after Kimathi, which later became a university char- tered and sponsored by the Kenyan state. in the center of nairobi, Hardage street was renamed Kimathi street, which joins Kenyatta avenue (for- merly Delamere avenue) and Mama ngina street (Queen’s street).
