i started to go towards the sound after the 2nd shot. From where we started to where we met njogi was about half a mile. We walked part of the way and ran part. i cannot say how many minutes it took us. yes, i thought it was 15 minutes between the 2nd and 3rd shot, and after that we started running down hill. it took us considerable time to do the half mile because we were avoiding ditches and climbing up. i fix the time at 15 minutes by the distance we had to go. The man who was with me had a watch. He did not take the time.
