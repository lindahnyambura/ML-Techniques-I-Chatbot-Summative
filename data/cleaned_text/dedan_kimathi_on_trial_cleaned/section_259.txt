The success of the emergency assizes in accelerating the pace of capital- case prosecutions in Kenya is evident, and was often praised by the more conservative senior members of the judiciary.29 The figures are indeed strik- ing: between July 1953 and December 1956, the special emergency assize Courts heard 1,211 cases in which 2,609 african suspects stood trial.
