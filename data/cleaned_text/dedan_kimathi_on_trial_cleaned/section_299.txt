they are spurned or ill-used after all they have done, they will turn against us and leave us with no means of control- ling the still Mau Mau–inclined masses.”70 if the british did not trust all loyalists, no more could forest leaders rely on all itungati. Mau Mau had no prisons; rewards for loyalty lay in an increasingly unlikely future; physical punishment and death were the only available sanctions. Kimathi’s opponents called this dictatorship. but there was also endless and earnest discussion, recorded in insurgent memoirs.71 272 i John M. Lonsdale Mau Mau’s public sphere shared with Gikuyu society at large its fear that poverty, land disputes, migrant labor, and now war, were all threats to ci- vility. itungati deplored the impossibility of marriage and parenthood— while depending for their supplies on mothers, wives, and sisters, a far from “passive wing.” Meetings called to decide military strategy soon turned to worry about this amputated moral economy. Kimathi’s peace feelers were motivated partly by a deep concern that war was bad not only for personal character but also for social relations, even for interracial un- derstanding.72 More immediately, rules of faithful cohabitation between male and female itungati were enacted to protect comradely trust from the corrosion of sexual competition. Kimathi, however, was said to flout his own rules by enjoying the company of a succession of women. Debate about the production of comradeship inevitably raised ques- tions of meaning and belief, both as taught by history. Most mbuci, or “bushes” (what the british called gangs), offered daily prayers to a God who was both the Gikuyu ngai and israel’s Jehovah; missionaries had long preached this equivalence between Gikuyu and biblical old Testaments. some fighters compared their warfare with the exodus ordeal that had once tested the israelites; the forest was a “course,” a proving ground, like the sinai desert.
