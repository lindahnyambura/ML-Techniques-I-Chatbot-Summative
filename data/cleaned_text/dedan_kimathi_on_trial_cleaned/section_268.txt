Anderson evidence regarding the intention of Mau Mau captives to surrender was a common feature of special emergency assize cases, especially fol- lowing the first surrender offer, of august 1953, and then again between January and august 1955, after the second offer. in 1953 the so-called green-branch offer had asked the rebels to give themselves up to the secu- rity forces clutching a green branch, to indicate they were not hostile. The leaflets issued to advertise this offer also asked that Mau Mau rebels should bring their weapons with them when surrendering. This offer, though su- perseded by later developments, was never formally withdrawn, whereas the second surrender offer, coming as part of an amnesty that also “cleared the slate” for Home Guard and others who might have committed offences in their counterinsurgency activities, was annulled by government order on 10 July 1955.50 Documents were produced in court to establish the pre- cise nature of each surrender offer, and it was accepted by o’Connor that a Mau Mau fighter might still, in october 1956, legally surrender under the terms of the 1953 offer and not be prosecuted. The question then became whether or not this had in fact been Kimathi’s intention. The court would eventually rule against Kimathi on this point, giving greater weight to the evidence of the Tribal Police who had arrested him, and to others who also confirmed that he had made no mention of surrender until getting to court—that is, until after he had been in consultation with his defense counsel.
