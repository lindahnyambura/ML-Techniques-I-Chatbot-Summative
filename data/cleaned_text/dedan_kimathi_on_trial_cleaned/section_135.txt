Do you remember how many time the charges and your reply were read over to you that morning? a. i am sure i did say what was said there. i have had a copy of it. i can’t remember how many times it was then read to me. Q. Wasn’t it read in english, swahili and Kikuyu? a. i don’t dispute, but i don’t remember. Q. Don’t you agree that what you said was correct?

Why didn’t you tell the Police officers that a policeman had tried to shoot you. a. i didn’t have strength to speak or i would have said a lot. i remember many days later Mr. ViDler and Mr. blaCKMan came to see me. They came once together and Mr. blaCKMan came once again. i was still ill. i tried to sit up but they told me to lie down. yes, i was able to think quite clearly that day. Q. Why didn’t you tell them you had tried to surrender? a. They were not in uniform and i did not know what part of Government they belonged to. They did not say they were Police officers and wanted to ask me some questions. i just thought they were ordinary europeans. if i had thought they were Police officers i would have complained about my being shot when i came in to surrender. There has been a european in my cell all the time since my arrest. Q. When ViDler and blaCKMan came in didn’t he stand up respectfully? a. i was lying on the bed; when i saw him he was standing  down. i remember the Magistrate coming to see me and asking me if i had any witnesses that i wanted. no, i didn’t tell him that i had been shot when i wanted to surrender. i did not know that it was right to tell him. i was informed that he was the Judge. re-XD.
