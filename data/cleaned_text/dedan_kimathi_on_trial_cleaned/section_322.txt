The Legal Illegality of Empire: Casting the Kimathi Trial in Broader Legal Perspective Without a doubt, especially given the historical significance and centrality of Kimathi in the struggle for independence, there is a real possibility that the publication of this archival find could fling open the door to a grim and an uneasy past and bring into question not merely the skewed sense The Unfolding of Britain and Kenyaâ€™s Complex Tango i 289 of british colonial justice but also the entire imperially inaugurated order and related issues of social and historical injustice.18 after all, the subjuga- tion, domination, and social control of africans, and the exercise of power in the allocation of resources and services under the colonial order, was through a flimsy and dubitable cloak of legality. Throughout human his- tory, when the legal process establishes a right of one particular person, group, or institution, it simultaneously imposes a restraint on those whose preferences impinge on the right established.19 in this particular case, in the name of the law, the rights of white settlers were assured and their privilege entrenched even while the just and legitimate aspirations of mil- lions of africans were delegitimized, repressed, and extinguished without contemplation, with arbitrariness disguised as legality.20 Moreover, the co- lonial order was contrived through legal prestidigitation. From the outset, the imperial legitimacy of power was, therefore, contested, and most seg- ments of the african population in Kenya understood that the colonial order had been possible only through the legal production of illegality.21 it follows, then, that the legality of an act does not necessarily make it a just one.22 Furthermore, it cannot be taken for granted that imperial subjects sensed that they were being directed by law as an arm of political ideol- ogy in ways that were not transparent to them; that, indeed, colonial law cloaked illegitimate power.
