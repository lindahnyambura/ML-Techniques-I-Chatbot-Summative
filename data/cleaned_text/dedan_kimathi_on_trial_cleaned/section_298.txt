under veterinary regulations he obliged less wealthy stockowners to take costly measures of disease control to protect the investments of the few; he also started a dairy cooperative and for a time employed Kimathi as clerk. While the latter is said to have run off with the dairy’s funds he nonetheless retained a tacit truce with his chief throughout the emergency. Kimathi had age-mates among Muhoya’s sons and school friends among the chief’s KGs, including one who tended his wound after capture. such local un- derstandings existed elsewhere. The british did not dare dismiss Muhoya, indeed used him as Kimathi’s postman (exhibit no. 25). While they sacked younger chiefs who pursued a similar neutrality, officials turned a blind eye to other senior chiefs who, like Muhoya, disloyally tried to keep a Gikuyu peace.68 Doubts about the allegiance of their Gikuyu allies also obliged the british to collude with those loyalists who fought dirty in a civil war that, forced upon them in large part by british policy, was bound to be a dirty one. as is better known now with the release of “migrated” records, white officials could and did act illegally—not merely looking the other way— to protect loyalists who abused their power for private gain or, often in revenge, mistreated, even murdered, Mau Mau suspects or captives.69 in early 1955 the government tried to save itself further embarrassment by disbanding the KG under a double amnesty that absolved both Mau Mau and loyalists of past crimes. The Fort Hall (Murang’a) district commis- sioner warned his staff to continue to tread with care; loyalists might still change sides. “They had no particular common cause with us, but never- theless fought loyally on our side.” They should be treated “with tact, fair- ness and consideration. if any fall from grace they must of course be dealt with according to law . . .
