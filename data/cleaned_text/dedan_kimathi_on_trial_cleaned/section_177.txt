The man did not answer: he dropped what he was carrying: started back, fell into the trench and made off along it in a direction away from the road. ndirangu and njogi ran after him. ndirangu called him to Kikuyu many times to stop; but he did not do so. ndirangu fired. The man ran on. He tried to get out of the trench on the forest side and ndirangu then fired at him a second time. The man continued running down the trench 140 i Document 2 with ndirangu and njogi in pursuit. He crossed what is variously described as a stream or a dry river bed, traversing the trench. (This turned out, on examination by the witness who made a map of the scene, to be a steep dip in the trench at which there were traces of erosion as if water had at some time passed over the trench). on the further side of this dip the trench slopes up steeply. according to ndirangu the man ran some way up this slope and got on top of the bank of the trench on the reserve side, which is there only about a foot high. ndirangu says that he (ndirangu) was then down below on one side of the “stream” (presumably in the dip) and that the fugitive was on higher ground on the other side of the “stream”: the man climbed out of the trench on the reserve side, but was curving round running to come back to it again when ndirangu knelt and fired a third shot at him. He staggered and disappeared on the reserve side of the trench. ndirangu and njogi went to the spot where they had last seen the fugitive. There was no sign of him. njogi remained there. ndirangu started to search. The two tribal police reservists from the next post, Mwangi s/o Kanguru (not sergeant Mwangi) and Maina, arrived, attracted by the shooting. after searching for some time, variously estimated at one hour and 20 minutes, (estimates of times and distances by illiterate african witnesses are usually quite unreliable) ndirangu says that he saw a thing like a leopard lying in some undergrowth under a small castor oil tree or bush.
