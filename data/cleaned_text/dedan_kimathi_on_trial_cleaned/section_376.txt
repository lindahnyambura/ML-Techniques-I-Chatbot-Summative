but now i am dull and tremulous / and every step seems only to lead / To a fall, deep and everlasting.”35 on the stage, this Kimathi is continuously diminished by his own words and those of his associates. To Wahu, his lover, he appears strange and afraid; to rhino, his right-hand man, “There’s something dark and ominous / That’s been clouding his imagination.”36 Watene’s desire to imagine a Kimathi whose actions and thoughts make him tragic, and yet one whose name will survive the scandals generated by the situation in which he finds himself, leads to two contradictory movements or mo- ments: Kimathi is simultaneously represented as the weak and haunted figure imagined by Henderson and other colonial writers; but he is also the heroic subject who transcends his situation and imagines a future of dignity and freedom outside colonialism. if Watene relies on Henderson’s 326 i Simon Gikandi book and not the other anticolonial texts available to him, most notably njama, it is because the colonialist trope enables him to produce a tragic hero, the only figure that can generate the mourning that is needed if the nation is to come to terms with its past, or at least establish a new relation- ship to the dead.37 like lear on the heath, Kimathi’s insights emerge when he is con- fronted by his own weakness and helplessness: The british hunt me down relentlessly To send me to the gallows. My mother has run amok and they torture my wife in the hope That she will lead them to arrest me. Those around me have grown faithless and those that have faith i cannot trust. My guardian spirits forsake me While my rituals lack their mystic power. My nights are thick with dark fears That sends me walking in my dreams. lonely solitude overflows my cup and this whispering shroud of the forest seems to conspire to betray me. What if i run off to a far country? What if i give up the pursuit of victory?
