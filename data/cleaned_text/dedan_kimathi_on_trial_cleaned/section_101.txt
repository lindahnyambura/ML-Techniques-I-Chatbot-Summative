i then arranged for the prisoner Dedan Kimathi to be transported to ihururu Police station. When i got there and retrieved the ammunition from Const. Waigwa. i later on the same day marked the pistol with a hack-saw blade on the under side of the barrel. i also put 3 marks on the holster. i look at 5 rounds of .38 ammunition and one .38 cartridge. This is the ammunition i took out of the pistol that morning. i recognise it because i put 3 lines on each round and on the cartridge case. none of the six rounds was fired when i marked them. later that morning i handed the six rounds and the pistol and the holster to insp. blackman of the C.i.D. nyeri. The prisoner was searched in my presence at the police station. i found on him 3 pieces of snare wire. These are they. i also found a wrist-watch. This is it. i found a chain round his neck. i found one corn-cob (maize). While he was being searched, he did not say anything about wanting to surrender. He answered questions as to his identity. He was wounded, but seemed to be quite comfortable. i was the first european police officer to see him after his capture. He was in my presence that morning for about 1 hour and a half. later that morning Cpl. Wanjohi came to me and gave me a {9 for iden- simi. This is it. (ex. 5). i handed all the exhibits over to insp. tification} blackman. Cross-examined. When i said the prisoner was comfortable he did not seem to be suffering from a bad wound. That is what i meant when i said “comfortable”. To Court. He answered his name and rank in english. He did not volunteer any remark. i speak swahili. He did not at any time say anything about wishing to surrender. He could have said this if he had wished, but he did not. i have no personal knowledge of how he speaks english. no further questions.
