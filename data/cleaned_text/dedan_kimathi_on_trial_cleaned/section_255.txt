This placed a considerable burden Mau Mau on Trial i 239 on the judge, working alone and often dealing with complex prosecutions of multiple accused and sometimes handling opaque or incomplete evi- dence. Kenya’s most senior and experienced judges preferred to continue with their work in the supreme Court, and so rarely appeared in special assize cases, leaving the vast majority of the trials to be presided over by the acting judges, many of whom were temporarily elevated from their role as resident magistrates. in consequence, the most difficult and politi- cally charged cases to come through Kenya’s judicial system in the 1950s were in the hands of the most junior and least experienced members of the judiciary. Presiding judges, however, were assisted in every case by a team of three african assessors. The assessors were selected from the same ethnic group as the accused, so that matters of custom or local belief and practice could be properly attested where they might arise during the trial, and so that a link would be established between the proceedings of the court and local communities. assessors were not there to pass judgment, nor could they “direct” the judge: their function was merely to offer commentary and advice. but the judge was not obliged to follow the advice offered by assessors, nor need he act upon anything raised in their comments. The role of assessor thus brought an african presence to the judicial process in the courtroom but gave africans no authority or power in that pro- cess.24 assessors were, in theory, permitted to question witnesses and the accused during the trial, and might therefore have served the useful pur- pose of bringing out or clarifying aspects of the case that might otherwise have remained obscure, but this was never encouraged and did not hap- pen in any special emergency assize case for which papers survive.
