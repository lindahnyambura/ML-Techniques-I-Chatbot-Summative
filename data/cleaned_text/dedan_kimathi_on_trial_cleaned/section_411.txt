The figure of the fighter, freed by the sculptor from his emasculating handcuffs in the classic “got- cha” image from 1956, was once again in chains.87 The Reparations Case While hailed as a triumph by (some) veterans, and certainly by human rights activists and lawyers, the settlement of this case, in 2013, has led to several problems—not least, a growing compensation culture in Kenya in which publicized “memories” and “histories” of alleged human rights abuse and loss suffered during and since the 1950s are touted as commodi- ties that have potential value in future legal claims. The case indirectly gen- erated dozens of public-trauma narratives (largely from people aggrieved that they missed out in the london case, who failed to understand that they had to have been clients of leigh Day to win compensation). These narratives may be regarded as counterproductive to unification and social healing—since they focus entirely on Mau Mau victims of the emergency period, or their descendants, with no acknowledgment that others may have suffered too, not least at the hands of Mau Mau; they reinforce the exclusivity of the “Mau Mau story,” and a predominantly Gikuyu one at that.
