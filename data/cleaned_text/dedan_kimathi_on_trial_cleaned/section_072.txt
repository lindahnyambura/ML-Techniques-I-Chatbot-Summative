before that Homeguard13 from the beginning – 1952. i remember 20/10/56 – saturday. i was a member of a party of tribal police and tribal police reserve under Cpl. Wanjohi. He gave us certain instructions that night. i was in a party under sjt. Mwangi – they were njogi, Mwangi (not sjt. Mwangi), Maina, njeru, Wanjiri. i think that is all. 5 and myself and sjt. Mwangi. We went to positions on the ditch which separates the reserve from the forest near Kahigaini Village. We reached ditch at 6.45. it was still light. sjt. Mwangi put us in position along the ditch. He put me with another man – njogi. To my right was another man from sjt. Mwangi’s group. i was near the road which goes to nyeri. others were placed – i could not see them. i was with njogi. sjt. Mwangi posted the others along the ditch on the right side (demonstrates). i was on the reserve side. ex. 1. i see this and the ditch and the road, the reserve and the forest. i was placed at point F. (indicated on plan). i was about 18 paces from the road. i don’t know where the others were posted. We stayed in our ambush all night – didn’t see anything. We didn’t move during the night. When it started to get light, we moved left away from the road. njogi moved with me. We were armed with .303 rifles. We moved very quietly, slowly, upright. i can’t say how far. it didn’t take long. We intended to go and see whether we could find any tracks. it was getting light. We saw something. We saw a figure of a person carrying something from his shoulder. it was not light enough to distinguish properly. it looked like poles. When we first saw this person carrying something i was at the edge of a shamba {farm plot} and at the edge of the trench. There was nothing growing in the ground at that time. The man i saw was moving towards the forest. The figure had climbed the bank of the trench and was on the forest side, about 3 yards from the trench when i called out to him. When i first saw the figure he was moving slowly.
