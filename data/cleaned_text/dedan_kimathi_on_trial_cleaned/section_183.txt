it is not suggested by the defence that on the 21st october, 1956, the mental condition of the accused was such that he did not know that he possessed a pistol and six rounds of ammunition or that, through disease affecting his mind, he did not know that such possession was illegal. The sole reason for this evidence of epilepsy is to try to account for the fact that, when charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, the accused did not, in so many words, say that he had the weapons because he was about to surrender and was bringing them in for that purpose. 146 i Document 2 The points for determination appear to me to be: i. Have the Prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt:- (a) that on the 21st october, 1956, at Tetu, the accused had in his possession a Webley scott revolver (ex 6); and (b) six rounds of .38 ammunition, or either the revolver or the ammunition? (2) that the revolver is a firearm as defined and that the am- munition is ammunition as defined. (3) if the accused had the ammunition in his possession, did the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that such ammunition was intended to be used in a manner and for a purpose prejudicial to public safety and the maintenance of public order? ii. if the Prosecution have established these matters or some of them beyond reasonable doubt, has the accused shown that it is more probable than not that he possessed the revolver or the ammunition or both because he was coming in to surrender in response to an invitation in a Government leaflet and was bringing his arms and ammunition with him? These are the questions which i asked the assessors to consider before they gave their opinions. They gave unanimous opinions that the accused was guilty on both counts and all stated that he was not coming in to surrender.
