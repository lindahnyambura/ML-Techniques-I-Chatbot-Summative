“big men,” both black elders in the increasingly crowded “re- serves” and settler farmers in the newly prosperous White Highlands, had begun to prefer property to clients; both cut down their tenants’ rights. The poor, betrayed by these once supportive patrons, lost hope of mar- ried adulthood. This social differentiation, a humiliation for many, blew the Kau’s multiethnicity apart. Moral economy had not been so greatly outraged elsewhere; other peoples shared neither this Gikuyu despair nor, therefore, their militancy.22 The emergency, or Mau Mau war, then sharp- ened this interethnic divergence; british counterinsurgency split Gikuyu still more clearly into rival vanguard groups—Mau Mau subversives and “loyalist” security forces.23 The crucible of war then taught Gikuyu, better than others, both how to press demands and how to use the state, whether to reform, repress, or attempt the two together.24 This ethnic exceptional- ism, finally, made it hard to imagine a common nationhood.25 This potted history suggests that strategy is argued within moral com- munities. What these are and how history has formed them are best ex- plained by a Gikuyu proverb: “those without previous dealings with each other have no cause to quarrel.”26 People argue most with their nearest, those whom they most need to trust, who share a moral economy—that web of reputational relations forever torn between self-mastery and neigh- borly duty.
