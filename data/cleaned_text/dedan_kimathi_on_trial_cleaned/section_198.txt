He started: night fell before he got to the Appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom i 161 reserve. He arrived in the reserve about 7.30 p.m.: he was afraid to go to any of the Home Guard Posts, for fear that he would be shot. being hungry, he went to find food and got some sugar cane and four maize cobs. He roasted his maize at a fire. Day broke before he had eaten. He began to walk towards the Kahigaini road. He was down in the valley and went up to the trench as the most convenient route to the road. He was in the trench about 150 yards from the main road. His intention was to stop near the main road, have his food, and then go along the road to Kahigaini where there was a police post. The accused says that he had no intention of returning to the forest. if he had so intended, he would have taken more food with him. The accused says that he was still in the trench when he heard a gun shot: he thought it was fired from about 40 yards away: he did not see who fired. There were two shots one after the other. The accused dropped his sugar cane and two maize cobs that he had in his hand and ran. He had no idea who was firing at him. before he had gone far, he heard a second shot. The shots appeared to come from the direction of the road. He ran fast along the trench and was still running when he heard a third shot. He was not hit. He got out of the trench on the reserve side and sat down under a castor oil tree about ten yards away. There was a steep slope there down to the Thengeraini river. He squatted on his haunches with his knees open. He sat there for about 20 minutes facing down towards the stream in the valley, after which he saw a man come up from below him – in front and slightly to his left. He noticed the man was wearing uniform and took him to be a policeman. He raised his arms and said: “it is i, Dedan Kimathi. i have come to surrender. Don’t kill me. i have a pistol”.
