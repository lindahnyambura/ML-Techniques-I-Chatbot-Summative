i unhesitatingly accept the evidence of ndirangu as to the circumstances in which the accused was first encountered and the chase in the trench, except that i am not quite so sure that the accused was hit on the bank by the third shot as de- scribed. i also accept without hesitation the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses as to the finding of the pistol and ammunition on the accused, and all the other subse- quent circumstances of the case.” in view of your Petitioner’s evidence that before he was shot by ndirangu he raised his arms and said “it is i, “Dedan Kimathi. i have come to surrender. Don’t kill me. i have a pistol”, and the fact that the rejection of this evidence depended entirely upon the reliability of ndirangu’s evidence, it is submitted that as the latter’s evidence was rejected or at least doubted by the Chief Justice as indicated in the above passage, the Court ought not to have found against your Petitioner on this vital point. your Petitioner submits that a further reason why the evidence of ndirangu on this point should be regarded with grave suspicion is that (as he admitted in evidence) he had been paid a reward for “capturing” your Petitioner. in order to obtain such reward it might presumably have been thought desirable by this witness to satisfy the authorities that he had effected the “capture” of your Petitioner as a fugitive and not merely taken him into Appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom i 167 custody upon a voluntary surrender. in this connection your Petitioner stated when found guilty – “allocutus: i wish to say that the Prosecution witnesses have not told the whole truth. They have given that evi- dence on account of the reward which they expected to receive. nothing else.” 11. THaT the three assessors gave their opinions that your Petitioner was guilty and he was found guilty and sentenced as aforesaid by the learned Chief Justice.
