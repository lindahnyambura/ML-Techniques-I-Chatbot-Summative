(1) Peace should be restored to the whole of Kenya which should become a country where all its inhabitants70 are at peace, par- ticularly the following - a) The Kenya Government b) The Government security forces C) The civilian population,71 including the settlers, D) Those detained, e) Those in prison, F) Those otherwise in custody, G) Those in the forests H) a call for a sincere surrender instead of sly calls for surren- der by sky-shouter. it must be a call for negotiations where both sides are sincere with the ultimate aim of friendship.72 (2) We would remind the leaders of government that war does not imply that there should always be enmity and hatred. War as such did not have its origin in Kenya. Kenya is but a small place. There was the 1914 – 18 war and then the 1939 – 45 war. Then we have other wars such as the Korean struggle with the classes such as Vietminh, even at this moment there is war in indochina. is it not fact that in all these recent wars those engaged have paused to negotiate for peace? 69. The Gikuyu is more definite about the identity of the people who are to be informed: it is the “muingi wa bururi wa Kenya,” the “general public of the country of Kenya” who are to be engaged. 70. For the term translated as “inhabitants,” the Gikuyu says “andu othe aria maturaga bururi wothe wa Kenya,” “all people who stay in the whole of the country of Kenya.” 71. The original gives the word “raia,” a swahili term meaning “the peo- ple.” it goes on to define “the people” as being of “nduriri ciothe,” of “all tribes.” 72. The Gikuyu original has the word given as “friendship” as “urata hatari ũirano,” “friendship without backbiting .” 200 i Document 8 (3) We would ask the government to recognize the fact that all those wars amongst the peoples of different places were not Mau Mau and it is wrong to say that we fight to revert our- selves to barbarism.73 if this is what we fight for it is evident that other nations have fought for the same purpose.
