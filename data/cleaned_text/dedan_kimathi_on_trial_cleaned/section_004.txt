But for too long, Kimathi has remained elusive—his words, his ideas (except for some writing by the Kenyan historian Maina wa Kinyatti), and even his body missing from the public realm. As Kenya looks to its future, it must also look to its past and return dignity and honor to the freedom fighters whose struggle for justice and human rights we carry on in the present. in the past, many of those who fought for this country have been side- lined and forgotten. on 20 october 1997, i went to nyeri with a group of committed lawyers and activists to plant a commemorative tree at Ka- runaini, the spot where Kimathi was shot and finally captured. We hoped planting a mugumo tree would, in some small way, pay tribute to the sacri- fices of our fallen compatriots. We were engaged in a series of mass actions to agitate for a comprehensive constitution of Kenya and this visit was part of this struggle. The Kenya police uprooted this tree and all of us were deported from the region. as part of my activism with various civil-society organizations in Kenya—including the Human rights Commission, where i served as ex- ecutive director for six years, and throughout my tenure as chief justice—i have called for the retrieval of Dedan Kimathi’s missing body. our patri- otic figures must be given proper burial if we are to honor their service and build upon their revolutionary visions. Kenya stands at a critical juncture in its history. We are engaged in a deeply transformative process.
