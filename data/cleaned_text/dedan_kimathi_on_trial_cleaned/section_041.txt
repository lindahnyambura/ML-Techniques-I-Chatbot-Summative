Popular accounts tell of Kimathi entering the reserve that day, as he knew a film would be playing at Karunaini village, an event that would pull the civilian population away from their farms and allow Kimathi to gather some food.99 Walking along the trench that morning, carrying a few ears of corn and some sugarcane, a troop of tribal police spotted his shadowy figure and began chase. The actual progression of the subsequent events during the capture proved the most contentious aspect of Kimathi’s trial. How Kimathi came to be shot and captured remains disputed. The tribal police reserve consta- ble responsible for shooting Kimathi, ndirangu s/o Mau, would be alone during the actual shooting, despite earlier claims by his partner on patrol, njogi s/o ngatia, that he had witnessed the shooting. ndirangu claimed he shot Kimathi in the leg as Kimathi attempted to reenter the forest. The evidence, including the X-ray of Kimathi’s bullet wound (fig. a.3 in ap- pendix), as noted by Judge o’Connor in his judgment, however, did not support ndirangu’s account. in 1985, at the age of seventy-nine, ndirangu would recount a version of the capture to a local journalist almost identical to his testimony to the court in 1956, save one addition: after being shot, ndirangu claimed Kimathi said to him “ni wega (it’s okay).”100 Kimathi’s demeanor after the capture prompts some interesting ques- tions. Kimathi was, by all accounts, an eloquent and effusive speaker.
