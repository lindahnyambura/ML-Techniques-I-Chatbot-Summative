i saw it was a man wearing a leopard cap. He was also wearing a leopard coat – like this. (2 for identification). This is the coat. (3 for identification)14 i spoke to him and said, “Who are you”. He replied, “it is i Kimathi s/o Wachiuri.” i said, “What about the other name?” He said, “i am called Dedan Kimathi”. i asked him whether he was 14. For exhibits nos. 2 and 3, leopard skin coat and cap, see photo 2, Dedan Kimathi after his capture, in this volume. For the possible importance of leopard skin in Kikuyu culture, see the introduction to this volume. Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 47 known by any other name. He mentioned something i could not understand, something like “billd Macho”.15 i then said, “Come out”. He said, “i can’t, because you have shot me”. i said, “Drag yourself on your side. Put your hands in the air”. He obeyed. He came out from under the bush. i saw that he was wounded – (indicated front of right thigh and buttock). it (bullet) came out at the back. i could recognise him. That is he. (identifies accused). He was searched. i and Mwangi Mwangi {sic} Kanguru searched him. i saw Mwangi Kanguru find a pistol on him – on the right hip (indicates) in a holster. i would not be able to recognise it. The pistol was inside under this leather jerkin (4 for identification) – under 2 jackets.16 Mwangi Kanguru took the pistol from him. i search him and found a simi. i didn’t pull it out of the scabbard. This in its sheath is the one i found (Tendered, ex. 5). i later gave that simi to Mwangi Kanguru. While this was going on others came. after i had searched accused sjt. Mwangi came with 2 others of our ambush party. The pistol was handed to sjt. Mwangi still in the holster. later Cpl. Wanjohi came. The pistol was handed to Cpl. Wanjohi by sjt. Mwangi – still in the holster. We dressed the prisoner’s wound – tearing up Wanjohi’s vest and tied the wound with it. it was not a vest: it was white cloth – like a shirt.
