a splinter group within the MMWVa immediately disowned the monument and called for it to be pulled down.76 The monu- ment is nonetheless a very significant addition to the postindependence memorial landscape of nairobi, and one of the few that features subal- tern figures, including a woman. The central figures are a male Mau Mau fighter receiving a basket of food from a female, their eyes deliberately averted from one another for wartime security reasons. With this monu- ment, Mau Mau has thereby been inscribed more fully into the city’s sym- bolic landscape than the lone statue of Kimathi (see below).77 To return to the Taskforce on national Heroes and Heroines, its final report (august 2007) was never published or made public.78 Mau Mau fea- tured quite prominently, but care was taken to suggest that Kenyans from all communities had contributed to the freedom struggle, a panethnic line that the KHrC has vigorously promoted (echoing Jomo, and ngũgĩ too). The report declared, “all communities took part in the Mau Mau activities in different ways,” and “the struggle for freedom by all Kenyans in their various communities, culminating in the armed struggle known as The Mau Mau War and the final attainment of independence was a macro- cosm of national and community heroism.”79 it was not until 2010 that the government held the first Mashujaa Day, or Heroes’ Day, which replaced the annual Kenyatta Day ceremonies on 20 october. Mau Mau veterans are central to this event, though from research evidence some are clearly being used to voice official sentiments they do not necessarily share.80 a Kenya Heroes act was passed in 2014, which established a national Heroes Council, whose functions include identifying and recommending national heroes for honors.
