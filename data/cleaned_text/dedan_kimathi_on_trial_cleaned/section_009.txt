• Before delivering their verdict, the judge summarizes the case but tell- ingly, his summary of the prosecution’s submission is fourteen pages, while that of the defense is only four pages. in the summary, the judge virtually directs the assessors to turn in a guilty verdict. • The assessors readily comply. They retire to deliberate on the submis- sions at 4:12 p.m. and by 4:20 p.m. (within eight minutes, in other words), they already have a verdict of guilty. according to Kibuthu, “He  is guilty. He is a gangster.” a gangster? That was always the colonial label for the soldiers of lib- eration, who fought the british under the name Kenya land and Freedom army (KlFa). Kĩmathi himself had already rejected the label: “i don’t lead terrorists. i lead africans who want their self-government and land. God did not intend that one nation be ruled by another.” Foreword i xv it was to refute the entire colonial literature and the demonization of Kĩmathi, along with the Kenya land and Freedom army, that in 1977 we wrote the play The Trial of Dedan Kĩmathi. Determined to celebrate the true history of Kenya’s liberation, we unabashedly embraced Kĩmathi’s firm rejection of the colonial terms about the nature and aims of the Kenya land and Freedom army. Consequently, our play depicts the trial at the nyeri High Court as a farce, for Kĩmathi had been sentenced long before the actual trial was staged there. He was being tried by the very system he was sworn to fight. The system became judge, jury, and executioner. our play celebrates Kĩmathi as a gallant leader of the Kenya land and Freedom army and as the symbol of the masses’ struggle to liberate them- selves and Kenya from colonialism and imperialist domination. Kĩmathi’s letters to the colonial government testify to this, just as they light up the clear vision of the KlFa’s struggle as a part of the resistance to interna- tional imperialism.
