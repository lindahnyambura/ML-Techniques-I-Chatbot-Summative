specifically, this refers to Kimathi’s identity-shaping disciplines and discursive practices through which he sought to transform himself into a formidable man of will and a practical man of action and power, and which also enabled him to as- sume, as a personal mission, the alignment of ordinary people’s everyday projects with authoritative images of the colonial social order.54 A Closed Double Riigi: All Crucial but Alienating Discursive Practices of Power as Derek Peterson has observed, Kimathi’s ensemble of representations and disciplines necessitating incessant writing, bureaucratic recording and record-keeping materials, typewriters, printing machines, and so forth The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 297 were ways of imagining a counterstate.55 More than being a hobby or ob- session, it does seem that Kimathi understood the nature and inner work- ings of power—above all, that it is textual, semiotic, inherent in the very possibility of textuality, meaning, and signification in the social world. Moreover, his letter writing and record keeping can, and should, be seen as discursive resistance or discursive articulation of resistance that informed Kimathi’s sense of self-identity and purpose.56 His identity-shaping disci- plines and discursive practices were a way of engaging with social reality, which cannot be known unequivocally but only through its representation in language. He was exercising discursive consciousness by putting things into words or giving verbal expression to the promptings of action.57 His use of speeches, text, writing, cognition, and argumentation can, and should, be seen as reliance on language to represent possibilities, and to position possibilities, in relation to each other.
