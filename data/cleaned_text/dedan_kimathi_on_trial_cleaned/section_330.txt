Moreover, his inclination to join the nationalist movement; to become a member of the Kenya african union (Kau), for which he served as the ol Kalou branch secretary; and his subsequent involvement with the militant out- growth of the anake a Fortī (young Men of the 1940s), “Muhimu,” made up of ex-servicemen, urban gangs, and frustrated political activists from whose ranks he rose quickly to become a respected oath administrator and organizer, all must have stemmed from a solid base of intensive self- organization.40 This sort of political activity demonstrates that Kimathi, 294 i Nicholas Kariuki Githuku as an individual, was organized enough to be able to seek to enroll, trans- late, interest, or oppose others in projects. This demonstrates his existence under conditions of well-framed knowledge that allowed uncurbed re- flexivity. Kimathi well understood how power relations constituted his identity, which is what ignited reflexivity that propelled him to pursue possibilities of what he could be(come). This reflexive self-organization of himself as a “resistant subject” was based on framed knowledge about who he was and what he could or should be, which is what enabled him to take a stand against the established colonial order. Kimathi lived at a crucial period of transition from african tradi- tional ways to a racially hierarchical colonial modernity—at a time, there- fore, when the very private experience of having a personal identity to discover, a personal destiny to fulfill, became a subversive political force of major proportions.41 Moreover, he knew about and sought to exploit the deep, fertile soil of brewing african dissent and real grievances, and naturally, the latently explosive transcript of indignation hidden beneath it.
