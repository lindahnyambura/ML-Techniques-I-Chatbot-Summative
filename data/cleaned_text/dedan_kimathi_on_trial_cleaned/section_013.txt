His introductory note to this volume speaks to the deeply personal and political nature of his relationship to this material. From the start, we were all aware of how important and necessary it was to attempt to engage ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o and Mĩcere Gĩthae Mũgo in this project. Their ground- breaking 1976 play, The Trial of Dedan Kimathi, has provided the entry point for many generations into the continuing relevance of Kimathi and this period in Kenyan history. ngũgĩ and Mĩcere honored our project by providing a foreword to this volume that is as insightful as it is provocative. Putting this volume together has been a truly collaborative process. i am grateful to my esteemed fellow contributors—David anderson, John lonsdale, nicholas Githuku, simon Gikandi, and lotte Hughes—for their patience, generosity, critical interventions, and scholarly camaraderie. special thanks also go to Derek Peterson and Joseph Kariuki Muriithi for providing the wonderfully rich and incisive annotations to the Gikuyu- english translation of one of Kimathi’s letters (Document 8). The african studies association (asa) conference in 2016 brought many of the contributors to this project together in one space. a round- table discussion, featuring myself, lonsdale, Gikandi, and Githuku, provided an opportunity to present reflections on the trial to fellow af- ricanists. The comments of luise White, David Throup, Mickie Koster, and many others helped shape the final product. at the conference, ngũgĩ and Mĩcere also graced us with a special guest lecture on the fortieth an- niversary of their play. The energy and excitement were palpable. Their reflections on the politics of naming and the enduring legacy of Kimathi provided great inspiration in the final stages of this project. My sincere thanks to the executive committee at the asa and to simon Gikandi and xx i Acknowledgments the Princeton african Humanities Colloquium, who generously provided the funds to make this event possible.
