He says that he was awaiting replies to certain letters which he had written to Government, but he does not attempt to produce those letters. i will read some of what he said as recorded in my notes: (reads p. 59 “My reason for eventually coming in....” to p. 60 “moonlight”.) 55 He said he was afraid to go to a Home Guard Post as he had no light and went through the shambas.

Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 133 he knew he had the pistol and the ammunition and that he was mentally capable of knowing that that was wrong, but he says it wasn’t wrong for a man who was surrendering and that he was surrendering. There is no defence of insanity. The issue in the case is “Was he or was he not surrendering?” The only reason this alleged epilepsy is brought up is as an explanation for the accused not having said anything to baker about his having come in to surrender in answer to the charges which baker put to him. That is the only relevance of the alleged epilepsy. Doctor Turner’s evidence is to the effect that from what he has been told by the accused, his mother and Joseph Wakaba, he has formed the opinion that the accused has epilepsy.
