Mau Mau’s forest leadership 260 i John M. Lonsdale was certainly divided, as the police already knew and a wider public has known since the first Mau Mau memoirs appeared, in the 1960s.14 at issue were questions of strategy and authority. all insurgencies are a gamble. Their strategic choices, none of them safe, cannot be negotiated between institutions; they have to be argued out face-to-face by leaders whose au- thority is daily subject to the harsh audit of events; disagreement is inevi- table. Kimathi’s defense focused on a strategic dispute, his peace efforts, not on challenges to his authority. but dissent over strategy is all the more likely, and likely to be bitter, when, in a contested cause like Mau Mau, new leaders arise and with arguable authority and untested ability demand that their followers be ready to die. The court had no interest in this side of the forest debate but for Mau Mau it was vital. at bottom the argument was about “moral economy,” being the reciprocal connections between per- sonal authority and collective action, social obligation and self-reliance.15 These relationships matter. insurgents disillusioned by the inequalities of the forest war became the colonial forces’ most valuable assets in the hunt for Kimathi. Kenya’s african politics had long been concerned with the same pro- found, intertwined issues of strategy and moral economy. Mau Mau was not unique in its strategic debates; its moral dilemmas were nothing new. Kimathi was not the first leader to risk assassination from within. Strategy and Moral Economy bethwell ogot, doyen of Kenyan historians, long ago showed how Mau Mau’s nyimbo, its “hymns,” tried and failed to reconcile moral economy and strategy, solidarity and action.16 With their diverse imaginations of history, religion, and politics, the nyimbo (sing., rwimbo) called up dif- ferent coalitions for divergent ends. Their political demands were secular and related to nationals, fellow Kenyans.
