The full passage from Mwangi s/o Wambugu’s appeals Judgment reads: “it is a matter of law whether a particular set of circumstances could constitute a lawful excuse: it is a question of fact whether in any particular case those circumstances ought to be accepted as a valid excuse. in every case, questions of honest or dishonest intention are a matter of inference from pri- mary facts: for example, long duration of unlawful possession without any ac- tion to surrender the arms would generally weigh heavily against an assertion of honest intention. The case of a surrendering terrorist is exceptional, because in his case there will generally have been long possession anterior to his for- mation of an intention to surrender with his arms. as the appellant {Mwangi s/o Wambugu} in this matter shrewdly remarked at his trial: ‘What is the pur- pose of inviting terrorists to surrender with their arms and ammunition? if they leave their arms and ammunition behind, what will be the use?’” Judg- ment, Criminal appeal no. 168 of 1954 of regina v.
