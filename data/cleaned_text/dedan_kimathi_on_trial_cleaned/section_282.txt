We cannot know how he came to agree with his defense counsel, Frederick Miller, a nairobi lawyer, how to pres- ent his case. However, the police interrogation he had faced three weeks before the trial must have helped him think out his best line of defense. on 31 october, a week after capture, he had been questioned by a Police special branch officer, anthony Dunn, seconded from the army’s Kenya regiment, a surprisingly young and inexperienced choice to handle so important a prize.10 Dunn’s report was not presented in court, for reasons that would have been at once political, operational, and legal.11 it recorded a story that in four respects was strikingly different from the evidence that Kimathi offered later in court. under interrogation Kimathi had said nothing about surrender, had claimed a longer command of Mau Mau, and admitted to possessing both pistol and shotgun. This was, in effect, a threefold confession of guilt—as that was construed by Kenya’s emergency laws. He had also, finally, at- tributed his colleagues’ anger to reasons other than the peace offers he had made to the government. Miller had “taken instructions,” as lawyers put it, from Kimathi before this interrogation and will have known the danger in which his client was placed. Miller had then visited nyeri again, presum- ably for more discussion, on the three days before the trial. These days of preparation and then the four days of listening to the prosecution case had given Kimathi and his counsel ample time in which to convert a confes- sion of guilt, made under interrogation, into a case for acquittal.12 How far they believed this strategy would be effective is something else we cannot know, but Kimathi had apparently decided not to challenge the trial as a farce, a bewigged mask for colonial injustice.13 Moreover, Kimathi’s defense had much truth in it and, since he knew enough english to correct the interpreter, we may assume that the trial transcript is a fair representation of his case.
