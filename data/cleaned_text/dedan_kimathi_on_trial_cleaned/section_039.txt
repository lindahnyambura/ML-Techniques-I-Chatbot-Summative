Kariuki remembered being forced to repeat the phrase “Dedan Kimathi and stanley Mathenge will be finished in the for- est” by the guards at the langata detention camp.88 Kariuki and others would subvert this psychological torture through some creative linguistic gymnastics: “fortunately the swahili word for ‘flourish’ (ishi) is very simi- lar to that for ‘finish’ (isha) so by mumbling in deep voices we managed to 16 i Julie MacArthur disguise this one easily.” The “song of Kimathi” elevated Kimathi to godly heights, with Kimathi, like the biblical Moses or perhaps the first Gikuyu man, ascending “into the mountains alone.”89 Kimathi’s very name became synonymous with the Mau Mau rebellion, for all sides. by early 1956, however, Kimathi was increasingly isolated, surrounded by a few loyal followers but constantly harassed not only by colonial forces but also by the komerera gangs that roamed the forests. The komerera were often former Mau Mau fighters condemned for their “idleness and cowardice,” as the term implied: “as vagrants they perpetrated anti-social violence, refused to cook for their leaders, and failed to fight the british.”90 Kimathi saw in the komerera all the ill discipline and lack of moral order that he abhorred. From the early days, Mau Mau leaders worried that the komerera gangs who operated on the “fringes of guerilla operational areas” would damage their cause and that the unprincipled banditry of these “thugs” could prove “politically disastrous.”91 as Mau Mau forces be- came increasingly divided, komerera gangs proved ever more successful in stealing their stores, harassing their troops, and causing disorder in the few camps left under Kimathi’s command. in addition, Kimathi had to contend with the “pseudogangs,” bands of former Mau Mau fighters who had surrendered or been captured and sent back into the forest to infil- trate, capture, or kill the remaining forest fighters.
