First, it “prompted many Mau Mau veterans to restate their demands for the history of their role in the liberation struggle to be nationally acknowledged and for their heroes to gain official recognition.”66 second, there were increased calls for the “true” history of Kenya to be rewritten from the veterans’ viewpoint and for this to be included in school textbooks.67 a surge of stories about destitute lib- eration heroes filled the media (not that they had ever gone away), with the government again accused of neglecting them, not least oneko, last remaining member of the Kapenguria six until his death, in 2007.68 Given their advanced age, the plight of these grizzled veterans was now more poignant than ever. Many, including oneko, declared they did not want a mausoleum or other type of memorial, and the bogus commemoration that represented, but to be helped in cash, now. The Kenya Human rights Commission (KHrC) began working toward a reparations claim, fram- ing this simultaneously as a memorialization and a human rights issue— recognition for liberation heroes and reparations for historical abuses were equally due, the commission argued. The then KHrC deputy direc- tor steve ouma akoth, who played a key role in the initial campaign, to- gether with Paul Muite and Willy Mutunga, explained the genesis of the campaign starting in 2003: We had four things in mind: (1) To expand the idea of freedom that had been developed in narC’s “velvet revolution”; (2) To revisit the myth that Mau Mau was a Kikuyu nationalist movement—our approach was that Mau Mau was part of the larger independence movement that had following and leadership beyond the Kikuyu; (3) Consistent with the emerging “era of human rights,” it was time to extend our broader campaign against impunity; and (4) that it was time to “re-frame” the history of Kenya from a human rights prism.
