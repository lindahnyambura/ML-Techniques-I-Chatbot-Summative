i will submit that his mind is, to a certain degree, affected by epilepsy, on which you will hear certain evidence; and i shall submit that that condition of mind influenced him and prevented him from appreciating as clearly as a normal person would do. i do not submit that his mental condition prevented him from appreciating that he ought not to carry a firearm but it did influence him in his actions subsequent to his arrest. This may affect the issue of why he did not say on a certain occasion that he had come in to surrender. soliCiTor-General: This is a letter written by the accused nearly three years ago and it is therefore difficult to see how he can pray in aid something that he himself said in order to support his own story. This is not the time to try to get this document in as evi- dence. if the Defence wishes to give evidence on this, they can call for production of it. at that time we can tell whether the issues are relevant or not. Miller: i would agree to that if i may now ask the witness if this is from the special branch file – from official custody. rulinG. The relevance of this letter does not at this stage appear. it may become relevant if and when the accused is called on for his defence and if his defence takes a certain line. it will not be admitted now; but Defence Counsel may apply to have it admitted later and may, in the mean time, ask questions of this witness to ascertain whether or not it is produced from official custody.
