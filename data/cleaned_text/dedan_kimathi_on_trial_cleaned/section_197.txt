He says that these were given to him in or about February, 1954, by one Macharia Kimanya for the purpose of defending himself against Mau Mau terrorists who wished to kill him. since February, 1954, the accused has been in the forest with five companions only. some others used to come and see him. The accused says that he knew about the surrender leaflets issued by the Government. There were, in fact, two lots of surrender leaflets, the first lot issued in august, 1953, the second lot issued in January, 1955. The second lot was withdrawn in July, 1955. The first still stands. The leaflet upon which the accused relies (ex. C) says inter alia: “all those who have not committed murder are noW given a chance to save their lives. Decide quickly what to do, to come in and surrender.... if possible, come out with your arms. you can surrender to any european of- ficer or to any other Government representative.” The accused was asked why, if he was relying on this leaflet dated august, 1953, he did not come in to surrender before october, 1956. He replied that this was because (1) there was a large reward offered for him and he was afraid that Tribal Police or Home Guards would shoot him to get the money and (2) he was awaiting replies to certain letters which he had sent to Government. The Defence were offered production of these letters, subject to objection as to their relevance, but declined to call for them. The accused said that his reason for eventually coming in was because the Mau Mau and the security forces were hunting him: at that time he was left all alone and he was ill. “i said it is better to go out either to be killed or, if i am lucky, to get to the Government”. He said that his intention was to surrender and to give the pistol and the ammunition to the Government according to the instructions which he knew. The accused said that he made up his mind on the 20th october to surrender.
