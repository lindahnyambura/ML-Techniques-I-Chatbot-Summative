This time-warping visual effect is reinforced by using the central charac- ter in the music video, the “actorvist” ndungi Githuku, who literally flees from the british military operations of the 1950s only to find himself in the middle of riotous nairobi streets in the 2000s.79 but it is the end of the video that is most instructive in terms of evok- ing the memory of Kimathi as a symbol of nationalism and decoloniza- tion. it is here that the audience learns that Githuku is playing Kimathi. lyrics to this effect are visually reinforced by the appearance of Githuku standing next to a painted portrait of Dedan Kimathi. like the leader of The Unfolding of Britain and Kenya’s Complex Tango i 303 the movement in the 1950s, he is arrested. in a powerful visual subtext, Githuku dramatizes the moment of Kimathi’s capture immortalized in the photograph of him lying on a stretcher while a white man, alongside, dis- plays the fighter’s leopard skin jacket and cap. but, more powerful is the visual superimposition of the two bodies, Kimathi’s and Githuku’s.80 The latter’s image, faded perhaps to symbolize Kimathi’s or the Mau Mau spirit of struggle, rises out of the former. This powerful imag- ery synchronizes the “distant” event in the past, which was the mo- ment of both Kimathi’s personal “defeat,” and that of Mau Mau, with the triumphant resolve of the present. both Kimathi and the Mau Mau struggle are symbolically liberated and disinterred in a heroic and victorious digital and, importantly, actual triumphant present. in this sense, this imagery is a transformative artistic gesture. The gesture presences this historical moment of apparent defeat while, simultaneously, familiarizing the audience with the present struggle by asking it to Look at the Times. it thus urges and demonstrates that times have not changed. it powerfully suggests that the struggle is still on and it is to be won.81 such valorization is restorative and redemptive with regard to Kimathi’s image.
