i considered that ndirangu and njogi were clearly telling the truth as to the circumstances when they first saw the accused climbing the trench on the forest side moving towards the forest and his subsequent flight along the trench when challenged and his refusal to stop – all this before he was fired at. They seemed to be witnesses giving a truthful account of what they had seen. and i believed ndirangu as to the firing of three shots by him. i was dubious about njogi’s statement that he had fired twice into the air. ndirangu says he fired three shots, and no one else seems to have heard any more than that. During the hearing i was dubious about nidrangu’s account of the wounding of the accused with the third shot. From the nature of the wound it was the surgeon’s opinion that if the accused were standing Judgment i 147 or running, the shot must have been fired from below (ie that the muzzle of the rifle must have been lower than the entry wound) and have been fired from about 75 degrees to his left. The wound could have been caused in the manner described by ndirangu, if he (ndirangu) was at or near the bottom of the dip kneeling to fire and the accused had gone some way up the steep slope on the other side, had got out of the trench as was running, circling round to his left to get into the trench again, as ndirangu describes. on the other hand, the wound could have been caused by a person firing in a kneeling position from 10 or 15 yards down the slope on the reserve side at the accused sitting squatting under the castor oil tree, from the accused’s left front. if ndirangu’s account was true, the accused must have been circling round to get back into the trench he had just left and in which his assailants were. This seemed intrinsically improbable.
