The law can be seen as an ide- ological weapon in the hands of those who possess the power to use it for their own ends.15 Contending sectional—sometimes ethnic, religious, or racial, and socioeconomic and even national—interests have ensured that the quest for fully fledged positive law continues to be a distant mirage, and, with this, assured the continued ephemeral nature of law, whether constitutional, property, contract, or criminal. Put differently, the legal validity or legitimacy of laws is contestable owing to its sociological construction. There is perhaps no better illustra- tion of such brevity or limitation of legal traction and moral relativism than the colonial system of justice that summarily sentenced Kimathi to death.16 The recovery of the Kimathi trial transcripts further complicates the historical entanglement between Kenya and britain and opens the question of how law often is the handmaiden of power. Whatever polity and in any era, law is, more often than not, a “system of enforceable rules governing social relations and legislated by a political system,” which can be a stumbling block. That the law is connected to the system of political ideas means that law and politics seem inextricably linked. it is demoral- izing but it is the reality; the life and heart of the law is never logic. rather, it is experience. in general, and in the Kimathi case in particular, the felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, institu- tions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices that judges shared with their fellow men, had a lot to do with the determina- tion of which colonial laws he was tried against, the court’s procedure, and its findings.17 nothing could be more discomfiting, especially when considering the imperial social and political construction of illegality.
