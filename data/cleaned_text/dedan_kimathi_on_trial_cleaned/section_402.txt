let him die!’ because he knew that he would  have no chance of being president.”50 Contrast this with the image of Kimathi, and his supposed relation- ship to Kenyatta,51 painted by ngũgĩ’s adult friend Mzee ngandi in the memoir Dreams in a Time of War: “it is Kĩmathi who will set Kenyatta free,” the boy is led to understand by an old man whose fantastical sto- ries enthrall him. They include stories about the lari massacres, Kenyatta’s trial, and Kimathi’s alleged magical powers—he was said to have “once disguised himself as a white police officer and went to dine with the gov- ernor.”52 ngũgĩ describes how this master storyteller mixed fact, fiction, and rumor in oral performance until “the real and the surreal were one,” leading him to conclude: “Perhaps it is myth as much as fact that keeps dreams alive even in times of war.” The same might be said of “memory,” at all times. Fiction and memoirs have been hugely influential in shaping contemporary public memory of Mau Mau.53 However, Kenyatta did not entirely shun Mau Mau. like his successor, Daniel arap Moi, he selectively rewarded or paid tribute to certain veterans while ignoring others. Clough divides the Kenyatta government’s treat- ment of Mau Mau into two periods: 1963–66, when the regime took care to distance itself, and 1966–78, when it practiced selective “rapproche- ment with Mau Mau veterans and Mau Mau memories the regime could use for its purposes.”54 in the second phase, Kenyatta initiated some of the first acts of state commemoration—such as laying the cornerstone of the Dedan Kimathi Memorial library near nyeri in March 1971. He used the occasion to pay tribute to fighters and said the place where Kimathi had been captured, just eight hundred yards away, “should be clearly marked.”55 Much of the amnesia rhetoric, combined with denunciation of Mau Mau, was expressed in Kenyatta’s speeches.
