The man who was being shot at was going up the hill and it seems that the shot hit him: he got out of the trench and went into the reserve side. after the shot was fired i saw him jump to the reserve side. This was another place where the bank had been broken down by buffaloes. it was about 2 ft. 6 in. high Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 55 (indicated). He then disappeared completely. There are some bushes there. i did not go to the place he disappeared. i went along the trench because i thought he might have gone towards the ngeraini {Thengeraini} stream. i got out and stood on the bank of the trench about 10 paces from where he had disappeared. i stood there to give ndirangu time to reach the Thengeraini stream. Then 2 other men came. one Maina s/o Chege and the other was Mwangi Kanguru. They were part of the ambush party. We spoke to them. We began to search for a man in the bush. We searched for about 1 hour. ndirangu found something. He shouted to us saying “the man is here”, in Kikuyu. We went there and saw a thing spotted like a leopard. i looked closely at it. it was day-light then. i saw that it was a person. He was wearing a leopard skin (shows shoulders). 2 and 3 for identification. These are the things he was wearing. From where i saw the man disappear to the castor oil tree was about 30 ft. While we were searching we were saying “surrender” in Kikuyu. We got no answer. The man in the leopard skin coat and hat under the castor oil tree was sitting lying on his side. He was not easy to see on account of the undergrowth under the tree. after ndirangu shouted “The man is here”, ndirangu said, “Who are you?” He replied “it is i Kimathi s/o Wachiuri”. This is the man (indicated) . ndirangu said to him, “What about the other name”? and he replied, “it is i Dedan Kimathi”. He also added, “it is i bild Marshall”. (Field Marshall). i do not know what language this is. i do not know what this means. ndirangu said, “raise your arms”. He raised his arms at once.
