i want you to ask yourselves these questions: (1) are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on the 21st october 1956 at Tetu, the accused had in his possession (a) this Webley revolver; and (b) six rounds of .38 ammunition or either the revolver or the ammunition? (2) is the revolver a firearm as defined? (3) if the accused had the ammunition in his possession, did the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that such am- munition was intended to be used in a manner or for a purpose prejudicial to public safety and the maintenance of public order? (4) if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did have this revolver, this ammunition, or both in his posses- sion then do you think it more probable than not that he had it or them because he was coming in to surrender and bringing them with him? if you answer question (4) yes i.e. if you think he had come in to surrender and had brought the pistol and ammunition for that purpose, you should give your opinions in favour of acquittal on both charges. if you do not think the accused was coming in to surrender and you find he had the revolver in his possession and that it is a firearm you should give your opinions that he is guilty on count 1. if you do not think he was coming in to surrender and you find also as regards count 2 that he was in possession of this ammunition and the circumstances were such that it can reasonably be presumed that the ammunition was intended to be used for a purpose prejudicial to public safety and order, then you should give your opinions that he is guilty on count 2. Please consider your opinions. if you wish to do so you may retire. i shall ask each of you his opinion on each count separately. 4.12 assessors retire 4.12 p.m. assessors return 4.20 p.m. 1st assessor: {Tumuti s/o Gakere} accused was not coming to surrender.
