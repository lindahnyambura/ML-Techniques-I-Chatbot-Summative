in court, the prosecution went to unusual lengths to clearly establish the circumstances of Kimathi’s capture and arrest, as his possession of arms and his malicious intent were at the center of their case. no fewer than seventeen witnesses for the Crown were brought into the dock, in- cluding eight Tribal Police and Tribal Police reservists who had been involved in Kimathi’s capture, and two african constables of the Kenya Po- lice and five european police officers, including CiD staff, who had been responsible for his detention in nyeri and his questioning. The nyeri sur- geon Dr. Denis Hurley also gave evidence as to Kimathi’s injuries. The final prosecution witness was Gitonga Wambugu Wamiatu, court clerk and in- terpreter stationed at nyeri, who was summoned to clarify the recording of Kimathi’s statement to the police from his hospital bed on 22 octo- ber 1956, confirming that he did not then mention that he was coming in to surrender.42 These witnesses were determinedly consistent in their evidence, leaving little for the defense to work with.
