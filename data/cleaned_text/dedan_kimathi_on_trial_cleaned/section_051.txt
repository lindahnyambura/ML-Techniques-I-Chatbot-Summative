Popular writing around Kimathi, Gikandi argues, further reveals contemporary “historiographic anxieties” and provides a “space of dislocating the truth claims of colonial and postcolonial history.” Finally, lotte Hughes’s chapter bravely dives into the murky waters of the ongoing battles over the memorialization of Mau Mau in Kenya, bat- tles that have often featured Kimathi at their center. Taking a broader lens, Hughes’s contribution offers new ways to think about the so-called “am- nesia policy” and “crisis of memory” in postcolonial Kenya, and the state and nonstate heritage projects that reflect the fragmented experiences of rebellion as much as their aims of reconciliation. examining the activism of Mau Mau veterans themselves in driving for public recognition, Hughes unpacks the national processes of memory making and the search for a “useable” Mau Mau past. If there is one aspect of this story that is beyond question, it is that Kimathi was a dedicated scribe. By all accounts, he was a careful and charismatic speaker; a bureaucratic leader, who believed in the importance of record keeping and history writing; an intellect to be reckoned with, in person and on the page. In 1953, when the CID complained that they still did not have a picture of the famed Mau Mau leader, Kimathi staged two photo- graphs and had them delivered to the Nyeri police station. In the second, he posed deep in the Nyandarua forest, head high, holding a rifle (see fig. A.4). At a time when the mere possession of a weapon carried the death penalty, Kimathi announced himself to the world holding a rifle. The East African Standard would publish a modified version of the photo, cropping out the rifle and centering only Kimathi’s face, carrying the caption “This is Dedan Kimathi, the notorious Mau Mau terrorist, on whose head there is a price of £500. . . .
