The first movement creates the historical canvas in which Kimathi will operate. in their stage directions, the authors insist that the play should take place in an atmosphere that is “tense and saturated with sadness,” one in which “the barrier between formal and in- finite time” is broken so that “past and future and present flow into one another.”42 Furthermore, for ngũgĩ and Mũgo, the stage is not just an area confined to a specific setting, but an open space, one populated by sounds, mime, movement and even noise. it is in this open space that the drama of decolonization is played out by characters whose roles are largely symbolic. Thus, the woman who runs into a well-known colonial gauntlet is not just a courageous individual, but also “a mother, a fighter.”43 she is a familiar figure in the visual representations of Mau Mau women being “screened.” ironically, like Watene before them, and Kahiga after them, ngũgĩ and Mũgo rely heavily on the existing discourse on Kimathi, most prominently the work of njama, which is also shadowed by Henderson. and because of this reliance on previous discourses, including colonial ones, The Trial cannot escape a familiar conundrum in narratives of decolonization: while ngũgĩ and Mũgo seek to establish a “true” historical perspective, they can only do so through a rewriting of the already given narrative of Mau Mau, including an account of the “farcical ‘trial’ at nyeri.”44 The authors’ chal- lenge, then, is to fall back on the already written narrative while mark- ing their distance from the sources that they abhor—Henderson, elspeth Dedan Kimathi: The Floating Signifier and the Missing Body i 329 Huxley, and robert ruark.45 The authors’ goal is to use performance to escape the historiographic trap; they seek to confront the event with the force of theatricality. Theatre, or performance, provides the space of dis- locating the truth claims of colonial and postcolonial history.
