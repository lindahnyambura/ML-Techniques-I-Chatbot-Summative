as we stated in 1976 in the play’s preface: We agreed that the most important thing was for us to reconstruct imaginatively our history, envisioning the world of the Mau Mau and Kĩmathi in terms of the peasants’ and workers’ struggle before and after constitutional independence. The play is not a reproduction of the farcical “trial” at nyeri. it is, rather, an imaginative recreation and interpretation of the collective will of the Kenyan peasants and workers in their refusal to break under sixty years of colonial tor- ture and ruthless oppression by the british ruling classes and their continued determination to resist exploitation, oppression and new forms of enslavement. in this regard, the mumbo-jumboish term Mau Mau was a british creation to obscure the clarity of the aims in the name land and Freedom. This very mumbo-jumboism has often fueled a scholarship that tries to di- minish the armed wing of the entire anticolonial liberation by describing the struggle that Kĩmathi led as a civil war. our play, The Trial of Dedan Kĩmathi, was based precisely on the rejection of the entire assumptions underlying that british kangaroo court in nyeri. but it was also a state- ment against the kind of literature and scholarship that authenticated or condoned that trial. xvi i Mῖcere Gῖthae Mũgo and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o Forty years since the publication of the play, our position remains basically the same: that the proceedings were a colonial narrative aimed at simultaneously giving legal legitimacy to the british colonial “system of justice” and helping british propaganda obscure the aims of the KlFa struggle. The Kĩmathi of the play characterizes the colonial system of jus- tice as one of protecting the man of property, the exploiter, while silencing the poor, the working masses. We also stand by what we said in our preface regarding Kenyan litera- ture and scholarship in general. To wit: as scholars, writers, thinkers, re- searchers, and intellectuals we are on trial.
