unfortunately, most Kenyans appear to be unaware of the existence of this museum and the peace and reconciliation work it and other peace museums do.42 The Amnesia Years on coming to power, Jomo Kenyatta ushered in a period of state- orchestrated amnesia about Mau Mau, which served his political pur- poses.43 The writing was already on the wall long before independence, as ngũgĩ reminds us: “some days later  we heard that Kenyatta had addressed a mam- moth rally in Kĩambu, denouncing Mau Mau with the expression “let it disappear under the roots of the Mikongoe trees.”44 (british propagandists Memorialization and Mau Mau: A Critical Review i 345 had also “sought to obliterate Mau Mau from public discourse in the col- ony and beyond,” in a change of tack from 1955.)45 The official mantra after independence was: “We all fought for freedom”—not just Gikuyu, Meru, embu, and the few fighters drawn from other ethnic communities; Kenyans were asked to believe that every group had done its bit to achieve libera- tion. However, it was blindingly obvious, not least to war veterans, that many former “loyalists” were now reaping the rewards of uhuru with top jobs in government and the civil service, land, and other official favors, while ex-fighters and their families mostly languished in poverty. such laments have been reiterated ever since, publicly and privately, as a core part of the expression of “Mau Mau memory”—which invariably cen- ters on blame. Writing about what happens when identity politics meets the “memory boom,” Jeffrey olick, Vered Vinitzky-seroussi, and Daniel levy note, “Most often, these identities nursed a wound and harboured a grudge. The memory boom thus unleashed a culture of trauma and re- gret.”46 i will return to trauma narratives later.
