The bullet had gone in on the inner side of the thigh near the crutch {sic} and had come out higher up on the outer side of the hip. The bullet had hit the thigh bone and had knocked pieces off it; but had not broken it completely i.e. it was still one long bone. There were no marks of powder near the wound or on the clothes, though it would have been difficult to find such marks on the clothes as they were dirty and bloody. The surgeon operated and the patient stood the operation very well. Monday 22/10 Mr. {sic} Hurley again examined accused and found his mental condition clear and normal and the surgeon thought him fit to be interviewed by the police. The effect of the injection  of the drugs which he had had on the previous 128 i Document 1 day had worn off. accused mentioned that his leg was sore and difficult to move and he had trouble with passing urine. The doctor relieved that. The doctor gave permission for this man to be interviewed by the police. after that interview the doctor saw him again and his condition had not deteriorated. as already mentioned the exit wound was higher than the entry wound – about 3” higher. Mr. Hurley explained that that means that the entry wound must have been higher than the muzzle of the rifle from which the bullet was fired. That could either happen if as suggested by the defence, the accused was squatting on the ground under the castor oil tree with his knees open and ndirangu standing below him and talking to him fired at him as he sat. or that wound could have been produced if ndirangu was firing at the accused from the trench and the accused was on top of the trench running and circling round leftwards to get back to the trench and the bullet was fired from his left side and from below him. ndirangu says that that was what the accused was doing when he fired the 3rd shot and that the accused was above him because the ground sloped up.
