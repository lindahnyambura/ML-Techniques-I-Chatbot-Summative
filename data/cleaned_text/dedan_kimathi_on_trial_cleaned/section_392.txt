to defend myself against those who wished to kill me, that is forest men . . . i mean Mau Mau.” in other passages he tells the court, “i said to myself: ‘it is better to come out  either to be killed, or if i am lucky to get to the Government.’ My intention was to surrender.” and, “When i wrote the first letter  i had abandoned Mau Mau. i was on the Government’s side.”6 it will be interesting to see what impact these devastating revelations have on contemporary popular memorialization, some of which revolves around this dock image and accompanying quote. For hip-hop musicians, their young fans, and graffiti artists, for whom dreadlocks and Kimathi represent the ultimate in resistance (both anticolonial and present day), the answer is likely to be “very little.”7 it will be dismissed, maybe, as fur- ther proof that Kimathi was framed, that his statement was altered, or that he was incorrectly quoted in court.8 Facts have little or no influence on memory and memorialization, which should become apparent as this chapter unfolds. Most important, the manipulation of these images by contemporary artists and rappers may be read as an example of the “re- appropriation of the  archive as a system of knowledge,” part of a larger “return to the archive  is informed by a quest for . . . utopian pasts and futures.”9 unlike other chapters in this volume, this one will not center so much on the figure of Dedan Kimathi as on the broader regime of memory around Mau Mau, contemporary and historical. Kimathi is not therefore as central to the debates that will be brought out here, but he and his me- morial legacy must be considered as part of the wider discussion. indeed, he and his literate comrades started it.
