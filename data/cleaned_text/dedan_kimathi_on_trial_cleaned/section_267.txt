similarly, it was reported in the East African Standard that Joseph Wakaba, the friend who gave tes- timony as Kimathi’s defense witness, had been brought to the court from the Manyani detention camp.48 There is no record in any other emergency assize hearing of a defense witness being allowed to leave detention to come to court, or of any defense counsel even making such a request. Having used the epilepsy plea to thwart the apparent confession to possessing arms contained in Kimathi’s statement to the police, the second line developed in Miller’s defense then sought to explain why Kimathi was, in fact, legitimately in possession of the weapon. Miller now lead with the claim that, when apprehended and shot, Kimathi had in fact been coming out of the nyandarua forest to surrender, bringing his weapon with him only for his own protection. This claim resembled the defense offered by other accused in cases heard before the special emergency assize courts, and, once again, Miller was well aware of the precedent. The specific case he had in mind was that of Mwangi Wambugu, prosecuted before Justice law in nyeri late in February 1954.49 Wambugu claimed that he came out of the forest to surrender, bringing his simi (short sword) with him be- cause he needed it for his own protection and to prove that he really was a Mau Mau fighter. The Tribal Policemen who apprehended Wambugu took him to the ngobit police post, where he voluntarily handed them a single round of ammunition he had in his possession. on coming before the court, Justice law doubted the claim that he had intended to surren- der and so convicted Wambugu for possession of ammunition, sentencing him to be hanged. on appeal this verdict was overturned, and Wambugu acquitted, the Criminal appeal judgment pointing out that the judge had failed to give any reason to disbelieve Wambugu’s story. 248 i David M.
