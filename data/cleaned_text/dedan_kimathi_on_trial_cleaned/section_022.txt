Mau Mau history has produced a wealth of primary-source texts, including colonial documents, memoirs, and per- sonal archival publications.29 archives from the trials of Mau Mau fighters formed the basis for anderson’s acclaimed study Histories of the Hanged. in this book, anderson demonstrated how these meticulously detailed court transcripts allowed the stories of the shadowy, nameless figures of the Mau Mau rebellion to be brought to light and to bring us closer to the violence and lived experiences of the end of empire and the making of a new nation.30 John lonsdale has argued that a careful reading of the trial of Jomo Kenyatta on charges of organizing Mau Mau, while secured through perjured testimony, revealed the ways the nationalist leader used “the law’s shield to turn the blow, to convert hegemony from mask of empire to argu- ment for nationhood.”31 Myles osborne has recently added to this litera- ture by publishing the fascinating interrogation and trial of Kimathi rival Waruhiu itote, or General China as he was known in the forest.32 Kimathi himself contributed self-consciously to this archival patrimony. He was an avid writer and believed in the bureaucratic work of documentation (see below). in 1987, Maina wa Kinyatti published a collection of letters written by and addressed to Kimathi.33 but questions of provenance, access, and translation have dogged the veracity of this archival collection.34 as with Kimathi’s contested legacy, irony marks the profusion, and yet also con- spicuous absences, of Kimathi’s historical records. if one searches for the “trial of Dedan Kimathi” in a range of search engines, one invariably finds not its archival record but the groundbreak- ing play The Trial of Dedan Kimathi by Kenyan authors ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o and Mĩcere Gĩthae Mũgo.35 Written in 1976, the play uses the theater of Introduction: The Trial of Dedan Kimathi i 5 the trial to reclaim and rehabilitate a lost history for a postcolonial world.
