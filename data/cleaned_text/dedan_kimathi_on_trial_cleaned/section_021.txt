oral accounts and memoirs, as we shall see, also produce contradictions and ambiguities. The fate even of his body remains a mystery, despite multiple attempts to locate and uncover his burial site.22 The recovery of the “missing” Kimathi trial file that prompted the creation of this volume provides just such an opportunity. some of the most heated historiographical debates mentioned above have centered on memory, political partisanship, and the use of sources.23 Controver- sies over classified, “missing,” or destroyed british archives on Mau Mau in specific and on the british empire more generally have grabbed head- lines in recent years.24 The activism of Mau Mau veterans seeking repara- tions from the british government has prompted an opening of files and a court case on the costs of the colonial counterinsurgency in Kenya.25 Huw bennett has written the first full study of the “hidden” colonial archive at Hanslope Park, home to Her Majesty’s Government Communication 4 i Julie MacArthur Centre.26 Historians bennett, David anderson, and Caroline elkins all played prominent roles in the trial itself, offering evidence of the “system- atic abuse and abrogations of justice” that Mau Mau veterans suffered due to the colonial counterinsurgency in Kenya.27 in 2013 the british govern- ment announced a negotiated settlement including compensation in the amount of $21.5 million to be paid to fifty-two hundred Mau Mau veterans. in 2014 a further suit, involving over forty thousand Kenyan claimants, was launched against the british Foreign and Commonwealth office for a range of alleged offences, including false imprisonment, forced labor, abuse, and denial of rights.28 even within this context of secreted or destroyed archives, the absence of Kimathi’s trial has been glaring.
