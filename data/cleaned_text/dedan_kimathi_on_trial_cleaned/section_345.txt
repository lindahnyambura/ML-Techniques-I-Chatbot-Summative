it (re)centers Kimathi within the core of calls for popular state- hood, social justice, and mutuality. This signifies two closely related de- velopments that deserve special mention, if anything, to interrogate what is now, more likely than not, going to be, with the recovery of the record of the Kimathi case court proceedings, under considerable ex post facto scrutiny: the unjust and criminal colonial law founded on the social and legal construction of illegality. The Unjust and Illegitimate Colonial Paranomon Law(s) under Ex Post Facto Scrutiny Glowing memorialization of Kimathi implies that he is increasingly being accepted as an hero of independence and the embodiment of anticolonial- ism and decolonization. This is happening beyond the limited boundaries of those who fought for, or were sympathetic to, the struggle for land and 304 i Nicholas Kariuki Githuku freedom, to embrace even erstwhile foes, if lack of any public opposition to this at the epicenter of public acclaim (nyeri, a region where the 1950s divisions ran deep) is anything to go by. Perhaps, more than fifty years of independence has brought about clarity of perspective as people continue choosing sides and now truly see which “side” of Kenyan politics they are on. Moreover, the release of trial transcripts to the public will bring historical reality closer and, no doubt, open this colonial spectacle, and Kimathi’s tragic fate, to scrutiny. in all likelihood, the result will be even more lionization of the man. now, more than ever before, he is bound to forever remain in collective memory as “the man in the leopard skin coat and hat under the castor oil tree.”82 second, there is a possibility that we might yet witness increasing appropriation and deployment of the memory of the anticolonial strug- gle, and Kimathi’s, in the task of nation and state building, even if half- heartedly at first.
