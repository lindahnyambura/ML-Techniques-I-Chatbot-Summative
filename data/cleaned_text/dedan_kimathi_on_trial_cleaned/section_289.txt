successive gen- erations were later named after the changes they had seen or pioneered. “readers” concluded that this tradition of invention gave their own gen- eration authority to change the future, too. in 1929, after a Christian girl was cut against her will and the law took little notice, some protested that “we Kikuyu ourselves,” not the europeans, had now ruled against female circumcision: “We are at the beginning of a great building up of new cus- toms and the forming of Christianity, the same as those before us made ordinances for the generations after them.”33 The defenders of clitoridectomy called themselves karing’a, true Gi- kuyu. They ridiculed their opponents as kirore, after the thumbprint each had put to a petition calling for readers’ daughters to be protected. True Gikuyu were self-reliant household heads; thumbprinters usurped this do- mestic autonomy with registers and rules, with paper. but karing’a soon had to adopt similar office procedures in order to compete with kirore, and indeed outdid the mission schools in giving the english-language tuition that made the case for imperial citizenship.34 This tension between household reputation and bureaucratic order, rival bases of authority, was another foretaste of Kimathi’s troubles. Mau Mau’s Debates on Trial i 265 The postwar Kau suffered the same tension at the national level. re- turning from england two years after its foundation, to become the union’s third successive Gikuyu president, Jomo Kenyatta (as he had become) still believed that ethnic self-help under propertied elders was a moral precon- dition of political responsibility.35 as if to protect rural patriarchy from urban, panethnic, bureaucracy, he neglected the Kau’s head office. Kau officials, all part-timers, could neither sustain the party newspaper nor pay the rent nor yet get many to renew their membership.36 but Kenyatta was of two minds, for reasons (again) of both strategy and moral economy.
