PoliCy anD inTenTions subject stated that he knew right away from the very start that the Mau Mau could not win, and he was always trying to negotiate 63. For further information on the “passive wing,” see the introduction to this volume. Interrogation Report of Dedan Kimathi i 187 surrender terms. His efforts at negotiation consisted of writing letters to the Governor which contained no practical suggestion for a meeting at all. subject would have liked to have been the big shot of surrender negotiations, but made no effort to join the talks once men, whom he considered his junior, had made contact with special branch officers. He has told the story of the surrender talks very much from his own point of view, and never had any intention of surrendering. His juniors realized this and calmly ignored him to his fury. reasons For Failure oF Kenya ParliaMenT KiMaTHi chiefly blames the failure of the Kenya Parliament to become a fully effective controlling body on the clash of personalities, and his writing of letters to the Government. He says that KiMbo and KaHuiiTina deliberately sabotaged any meetings that they attended, and prevented working decisions from being reached, whilst other influential leaders such as nDunGu GiCHeru ignored requests to attend. subject also stated many times that the Policy line that he laid down over the reserves, brought him into sharp conflict with other leaders. KiMaTHi forbade the residence in reserves of gangs, and also forbade the collection of money and the prostitution of young girls, on the grounds that if patrols caught gangsters in huts in villages, many people who were not of the forest would be killed. as subject had all the comforts of home in the forest, at least in the early days, and many of his minions were not so well placed, this argument rather fell on deaf ears.
