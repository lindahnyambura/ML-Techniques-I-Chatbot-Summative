if we are to enter a past country in its own con- text, with its own tragic sense of unanswerable questions then we have to subvert subversive history too. in this reflection i again follow ogot, who criticized the unanim- ity that the historian Michelet imposed on France’s eighteenth-century Mau Mau’s Debates on Trial i 277 revolutionaries. “This assumed unanimity,” ogot thought, was “confusing and unhelpful to the historian who seeks to understand the nature of the French revolution. such a historian must ask how unanimous the struggle was. Were there no cross-currents?”88 if we want to understand the past for its own sake rather than use it for ours then that is one of the first questions any historian must ask.
