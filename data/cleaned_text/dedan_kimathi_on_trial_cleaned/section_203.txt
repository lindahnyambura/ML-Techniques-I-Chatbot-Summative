THaT in relation to the question as to whether your Petitioner was coming in to surrender the learned Chief Justice directed the assessors to consider, inter alia, the alleged omission of your Petitioner to make any statement of this fact to his cap- tors, as follows:- “Do you believe accused was surrendering? according to the prosecution accused was: Appeal to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom i 165 (i) seen going in the direction of the forest; (ii) he ran away when challenged; (iii) he said nothing about surrender to anyone in authority – either his captors or sgt. Mwangi, Cp. Wanjohi or inspector sloan or the Doctor or superintendent baker or superinten- dent Vidler or the magistrate. “He says that he did not know that blackman and Vidler were Police officers. you may think that as they came to see him when he was under close arrest to ask him questions about security matters, he must have thought that they were persons in authority. isn’t it odd that he didn’t say: ‘i am wrongly confined. i have been wrongly charged with possession a firearm {sic}, when all i was doing was coming in to surrender it’? if that was true you may think it odd that he didn’t say it. is it something that he has thought of since? it is for you to consider. He says he has told some of his european escorts. He has not called any of them to say so.” similarly in his Judgment the Chief Justice observed:- “From first to last, neither to sergeant Mwangi, Corporal Wanjohi, inspector sloan, Mr. Hurley nor superinten- dent baker did the accused say one word about having come in to surrender, and he made no complaint that he had been shot while trying to surrender. When charged with possession of a firearm and ammunition, he did not say that he was surrendering and bringing them in for the purpose of giving them up.
