From a historical perspective, as the other essays in this volume vividly illustrate, Kimathi’s symbolic power is en- hanced by the enemies who demonize him and the followers who adore him. but i believe his control over the symbology of Mau Mau goes be- yond his charisma or personality. What makes Kimathi stand outside the collective, symbolic economy of Mau Mau is that he is not there to fill the obvious gaps in his life story: Why was he expelled from Tumutumu mis- sion school? What actually happened to him when he joined the army? How did he end up in the settled areas? When, how, and why did he end up in the forest? it is this incompleteness that makes Kimathi the ideal sub- ject of tragic drama, of the imaginary reconstruction of history. Kimathi becomes a unique subject for drama because of what susan letzer Cole calls, in a different context, “the paradox of embodied absence.”23 in other words it is when we are confronted by gaps in Kimathi’s story that the force of what lacan calls the imaginary becomes crucial to understanding the poetics and politics of memory. For lacan, the imaginary is necessitated by the discovery that the essential condition of the human subject is one of loss and separation. Confronted by a situation of loss, or what lacan calls lack, the human subject comes to a realization that its needs and desires cannot be fulfilled and hence turns to create an image, a fantasy, that will function as a substitute for the real.24 although lacan is writing about the child coming to an identity of itself as an individual, his formulation can be applied to postcolonial sub- jects who discover that the dream of independence—the symbolic order, which should have been embodied by a figure like Kimathi—is difficult to realize. The difficulty of coming into being as a postcolonial subject in independent Kenya can be explained in two ways.
