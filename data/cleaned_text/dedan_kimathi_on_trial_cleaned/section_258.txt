Whyatt’s objections were swept aside on the grounds of practicalities, but Mau Mau on Trial i 241 he gained the proviso that the court would have the right to exclude any such statement from the record of evidence if the judge had any doubt that the statement was freely made and a correct record.26 This placed the burden squarely on the judge: if the accusations of abuse and duress made by the defense counsel related to the extrajudicial statement, then it was incumbent on the judge to establish the facts so that the statement could be held as evidence. Failure to treat such accusa- tions properly might result in the appeals court overturning a guilty ver- dict. This led to a series of “trials within a trial,” with the judge asking the court to be cleared and the assessors withdrawn, while the attesting officer (normally a police officer, more rarely a magistrate) was called to deny the accusation of duress, or doctors were called to examine the prison- ers. While it was evident by their injuries that prisoners had been abused, judges were reluctant to wholly dismiss the extrajudicial statements and so steered a careful course between allowing the statement to stand—on the basis that the timing and circumstances of the beatings could not be established—and ensuring that any conviction did not rest solely on the confessional evidence contained in the statement. While judges did, from time to time, express their unease at this situation,27 and it is clear that the appeals court seized upon evidence of the abuse of prisoners by officers of the state whenever it was presented to them,28 the routinized beatings of prisoners in interrogations was vividly reflected in the proceedings of the special emergency assizes.
